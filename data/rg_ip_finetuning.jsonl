{"text": "Reverse Genetics for Influenza A and B Viruses Driven by Swine Polymerase I Promoter. \n Abstract \n Influenza viruses are considered prominent pathogens of humans and animals that are extensively investigated because of public health importance. Plasmid-based reverse genetics is a fundamental tool that facilitates the generation of genetically modified viruses from a cDNA copy. The ability to rescue viruses enables researchers to understand different biological characteristics including IV replication, pathogenesis, and transmission. Furthermore, understanding the biology and ability to manipulate different aspects of the virus can aid in providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of antiviral resistance and development of alternative vaccination strategies. This chapter describes the process of cloning cDNA copies of IAV and IBV RNA segments into a swine polymerase-driven reverse genetics plasmid vector, successful generation of recombinant IVs in swine cells, and propagation of virus in cells or eggs. The swine polymerase reverse genetics system was previously shown to be efficient for de novo rescue of human-, swine-, and avian-origin IAVs and IBV in swine and human origin cell lines utilizing the same protocols discussed in this chapter.Key wordsInfluenzaReverse geneticsTissue cultureVirusReplicationAuthors Brittany Seibert and Stivalis Cardenas-Garcia are contributed equally to this work.\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDownload protocol PDF\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpringer Nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate Protocols.\u00a0Learn more\n\n\n1 IntroductionInfluenza viruses are classified within the family orthomyxoviridae as segmented, single-stranded, negative sense RNA viruses [1]. Influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses are human and/or animal pathogens widely studied due of their importance to public health and animal production. IAV infects a broad host range of avian and mammalian species while IBV is primarily a human pathogen [2, 3]. While influenza A and B viruses differ in host range, they share many features. Both IAV and IBV possess a segmented, negative sense RNA genome composed of eight viral gene segments that encode for at least 12 viral proteins [4,5,6]. Each gene segment consists of a coding region (sometimes encoding for more than one polypeptide) flanked by short untranslated regions (UTRs). Influenza viruses contain two surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin\n\n (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) [7], which are the main antigenic determinants that elicit neutralizing antibodies and play a key role in infection and propagation within the host [8,9,10,11]. IAVs are classified by their HA and NA into subtypes in which currently, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been described [12,13,14]. Although IAV and IBV have similar genome structure, they diverge in the lengths of proteins and noncoding regions, the presence of accessory proteins, and antigenic properties of the internal proteins [3, 6, 15, 16]. Despite the structural and molecular differences between IAV and IBV, both can be generated by reverse genetics through similar approaches [17, 18].Reverse genetics (RG) is an essential tool that allows for the generation of genetically modified RNA and DNA viruses from a cDNA copy [19]. This technique is highly employed in influenza virus research to understand different aspects of influenza replication, pathogenesis, transmission, and vaccine development [20,21,22]. Plasmid-based RG systems must produce two types of RNAs: (1) negative sense, viral genomic RNA copies of each segment for replication (vRNA), and (2) messenger RNA copies of the structural components, notably the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP; comprised of the three RNA polymerase subunits PB1, PB2, and PA and the nucleoprotein (NP)) [23]. While many plasmid- and vector-based systems have been established, one of the more efficient systems consists of utilizing eight bidirectional plasmids containing RNA polymerase I and II transcription units in opposite orientations flanking the cloned IAV/IBV gene segment [23, 24]. The first unit contains a polymerase I promoter (pol I) and a polymerase I transcription terminator (TI) for the synthesis of single-stranded, negative sense, uncapped vRNAs [23, 25]. The second unit consists of an RNA polymerase II promoter (pol II) and a pol II poly A signal for the transcription of mRNA [6, 25, 26].Previous reports have illustrated that the RNA pol I promoter has species specificity, which could potentially affect the efficiency of virus rescue [27, 28]. Recently, a bidirectional plasmid containing the swine pol I promoter (spol I) has been developed as an alternative reverse genetics bidirectional vector (referred to as pPIG2012) [29]. This plasmid vector was derived from an established bidirectional plasmid vector containing the human pol I (hpol I) (pDP2002) [23, 30]. The pPIG2012 RG vector was demonstrated to be efficient for de novo rescue of human-, swine- and avian-origin IAVs and IBV in swine and human origin cell lines [29]. Since swine-origin cells such as PK-15 cells have been previously used for vaccine production [31, 32], the pPIG2012 RG system expands the applicability regarding animal vaccine production [29]. Utilizing the spol I RG system could be advantageous in transfection efficiency for the generation and/or expansion of influenza viruses but also limiting the potential for substrate-adapted changes, particularly to produce swine vaccines [29].In this chapter we describe the details of reverse genetics techniques for type A and B influenza viruses using the 8-plasmid system with bidirectional promoters as described by Hoffman et al. [24] using the spol I system. The plasmid used in this chapter, pPIG2012, is a derivative of pDP2002 [23], in which the hpol I promoter was replaced with a minimal spol I promoter from the 45S ribosomal RNA promoter region of Sus scrofa [29]. The pPIG2012 plasmid (Fig. 1) contains the swine RNA pol I promoter (spol I) and an RNA polymerase II-driven cytomegalovirus (pCMV) promoter in opposite orientations. The spol I unit contains the promoter and TI to produce vRNAs with defined start and stop sites. The pCMV unit contains the promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (aBGH). Influenza A and B cDNAs are cloned into the pPIG2012 RG vector using restriction sites artificially introduced at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of each gene segment that are compatible with the restriction sites (BsmBI) on the pPIG2012 RG vector cloning region. We will provide primer specifications for cloning IAV A/turkey/Ohio/313053/2004 (H3N2) (Ty04) and IBV B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Bris) into pPIG2012 (Table 1).Fig. 1Influenza vRNA cloning into pPIG2012 plasmid vector. Schematic representation of the pPIG2012 plasmid containing the swine polymerase I promoter (spol I, pink arrow) and the mouse\n\n polymerase I transcription terminator (TI, orange box) sequences that produce single-stranded, negative sense, uncapped IV vRNA synthesis. In the opposite direction of the spol I unit, a polymerase II-directed cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV; blue arrow) and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (aBGH; green box) directs the synthesis of IV proteins from viral cDNA. The plasmid also contains an ampicillin resistant gene (Ampr, grey box). Briefly, IV vRNAs are amplified by RT-PCR containing BsmBI or a compatible restriction enzyme site sequences. Following, the cDNAs are digested with the restriction enzyme and ligated into pPIG2012 BsmBI-digested plasmid vector containing the same sequence overhang. The process is to be repeated to generate eight IV plasmids for virus rescue (right)Full size imageTable 1 Primers used to clone IAV and IBV into pPIG2012Full size table2 Materials2.1 Influenza A and B Viral RNA (vRNA) Extraction\n\n\n1.\nViral RNA extraction kit (i.e., QiAmp, QIAGEN).\n\n\n2.\n200 proof ethanol (molecular grade).\n\n\n3.\n1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\n\n4.\nNuclease-free water or DEPC-treated ddH2O.\n\n\n5.\nSolution for the removal of RNases (i.e., RNaseZap, Sigma).\n\n\n6.\nPipets to dispense from 1 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcL and corresponding filter pipet tips.\n\n\n7.\nLaboratory equipment: pipettes and tips of appropriate sizes, vortex, microcentrifuge with a rotor capable of reaching up to 12,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g, spectrophotometer (NanoDrop or similar).\n\n\n2.2 Influenza A and B cDNA Synthesis\n\n\n1.\nInfluenza A virus Universal Uni-12 primer (5\u2032-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3\u2032), 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL stock.\n\n\n2.\nInfluenza B virus Universal Uni-11-A primer (5\u2032-AGCAGAAGCGG-3\u2032; for segments 1, 2 and 3), 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL stock.\n\n\n3.\nInfluenza B virus Universal (Uni)-11-B primer (5\u2032- AGCAGAAGCAG-3\u2032; for segments 4, 6, and 8), 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL stock.\n\n\n4.\nInfluenza B virus Universal (Uni)-11-C primer (5\u2032-AGCAGAAGCAC-3\u2032; for segments 5 and 7), 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL stock.\n\n\n5.\nAvian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (RT) and buffer.\n\n\n6.\nRNAse inhibitor (i.e., RNasin 40\u00a0U/\u03bcL, Promega).\n\n\n7.\ndNTP mix, 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM each.\n\n\n8.\nNuclease-free water or DEPC-treated ddH2O.\n\n\n9.\n1.5\u00a0mL tubes.\n\n\n10.\n250\u00a0\u03bcL PCR tubes.\n\n\n11.\nLaboratory equipment: vortex, table-top minicentrifuge, and thermocycler.\n\n\n2.3 Amplification of Influenza A and B Gene Segments from  cDNA\n\n\n1.\nInfluenza A primer set for cloning the eight gene segments into pPig2012 bidirectional reverse genetics plasmid vector (Table 1).\n\n\n2.\nInfluenza B primer set for cloning the eight gene segments into pPig2012 bidirectional reverse genetics plasmid vector (Table 1).\n\n\n3.\nRoche Expand high fidelity PCR system (Sigma Millipore).\n\n\n4.\ndNTP mix, 10\u00a0\u03bcM each.\n\n\n5.\nNuclease-free water or DEPC-treated ddH2O.\n\n\n6.\nAgarose, LE analytical grade.\n\n\n7.\nDNA gel staining solution (i.e., SYBR\u00ae Safe).\n\n\n8.\n1\u00a0kb ladder.\n\n\n9.\nGel extraction kit (i.e., QIAquick QIAGEN).\n\n\n10.\n1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\n\n11.\n250\u00a0\u03bcL PCR tubes.\n\n\n12.\nIce or cooling tube racks.\n\n\n13.\nLaboratory equipment: pipettes and tips of appropriate sizes, vortex, microcentrifuge with a rotor capable of reaching up to 12,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g, thermocycler, DNA gel electrophoresis system, transilluminator, water bath or heating block capable of reaching 50\u00a0\u00b0C, scale capable of determining weight in milligrams, NanoDrop (or similar spectrophotometer).\n\n\n2.4 Bidirectional Reverse Genetics pPIG2012 Plasmid VectorThe plasmid pPIG2012 (Fig. 1) was derived from pDP2002 [23, 30], which contains a 29\u00a0nucleotides spacer sequence cloned between two BsmBI sites to easily discern the double-digested vector and to flexibly clone full length IAV or IBV cDNAs.

See Table 1 for gene-specific primers to be used.\n\n1.\nIn a PCR tube, prepare reaction mix 1 as follows and keep on ice:\n\n(a)\ncDNA: 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(b)\nForward Primer (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL): 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(c)\nReverse Primer (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL): 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n\n\n2.\nIn a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare reaction mix 2 as follows (adjust volume accordingly based on number of reactions needed. 25\u00a0\u03bcL reactions can be prepared by cutting in halve the volumes for each reagent):\n\n(a)\ndNTPs (10\u00a0\u03bcM each): 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(b)\n10\u00d7 Expand HF Buffer: 5.0\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(c)\nExpand HF: 0.75\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(d)\nNuclease-free water: 39.25\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n\n\n3.\nAdd 45\u00a0\u03bcL of mix 2 per each tube containing your mix 1.\n\n\n4.\nMix well and briefly spin down to collect the contents at the bottom of the tube.

Each of these segments is flanked by restriction sites compatible with the pPig2012 reverse genetics vector.3.5 Cloning of IAV and IBV Gene Segments into pPIG2012 (See Fig. 2)\n\n\n1.\nUsing the purified PCR products from step 10, Subheading 3.4, set up the enzymatic digestions as follows:\n\n(a)\nPurified PCR product: 26\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(b)\n10\u00d7 Restriction endonuclease buffer: 3\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(c)\nEndonuclease (BsmBI, BsaI, or AarI): 1\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n\n\n2.\nPerform digestions at 37\u00a0\u00b0C (BsaI and AarI) or 55\u00a0\u00b0C (BsmBI) for 4\u00a0h to overnight in a thermocycler or other device able to reach the required temperatures but some considerations need to be taken into account (see Note 7).\n\n\n3.\nNext, purify the digested fragment using MinElute PCR Purification Kit. Digested product is eluted using 10\u00a0\u03bcL of elution buffer and measure the concentration using the spectrophotometer of your choice. Gel purification of PCR product after digestion is not necessary.

Ligation reactions can be stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C if it cannot be used for transformation the same day.\n\n\n14.\nTransform ligations reactions into TOP10 cells following manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n\n15.\nSpread 100\u00a0\u03bcL of transformation rxn onto LB agar plates supplemented with 50\u00a0\u03bcg of ampicillin.\n\n\n16.\nSet to incubate overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Transformants can be screened by colony PCR (cPCR) the following day.\n\n\nFig. 2Rescue of IAV and IBV viruses through reverse genetics. Eight reverse genetics plasmids carrying the corresponding IAV or IBV gene segments are transfected into PK-15/MDCK cell co-cultures. After virus recue has been confirmed, the infectious cell culture supernatants are inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs or into MDCK cell monolayers for stock preparation. Aliquots from the newly generated virus stocks are prepared and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until neededFull size image\n3.6 Screening of Transformant Colonies by  cPCRAfter 16\u00a0h of incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, plates from step 15, Subheading 3.5, should have colonies with potential positive reverse genetics (RG) clones carrying the desired IAV and IBV gene segments. It is recommended to screen between 5 and 10 transformant colonies. To screen for RG clones carried into the pDP2002 vector, we recommend using the following primer set: PTI2F (5\u2032-CTAGCAGTTAACCGGAGTACTGGT-3\u2032) and SwinePol1Rev (5\u2032-CAGGGCTGGGGGACAAGTG-3\u2032).\n\n1.\nBefore starting, pre-warm an LB agar plate (with 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of ampicillin). Draw a grid and label the compartments with the corresponding colony ID numbers. This plate will serve to save a copy of the colonies selected for screening.\n\n\n2.\nIn a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare cPCR reactions as follows (amounts disclosed bellow are per reaction, adjust depending on the number of reactions to be performed):\n\n(a)\n2\u00d7 GoTaq Master mix: 5.0\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(b)\nPTI2F (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL stock): 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(c)\nSwinePol1Rev (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL stock): 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n(d)\nNuclease-free water: 4.0\u00a0\u03bcL\n\n\n\n\n3.\nAliquot 10\u00a0\u03bcL of reaction mix into 250\u00a0\u03bcL PCR tubes.\n\n\n4.\nWith a sterile 10\u00a0\u03bcL pipette tip or a sterile toothpick, collect the selected colonies one at a time, perform this procedure under the flame to keep sterility. Then touch the pre-warmed LB plate (see step 1) to inoculate the bacteria on the surface of the agar (within the designated compartment). Set plate to incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight.\n\n\n5.\nNext, immerse the same bacteria containing tip and pipet up and dawn into the corresponding cPCR mix tube.\n\n\n6.\nMix well and briefly spin down to collect contents at the bottom of the tube. Always keep reactions on ice until they are loaded in the thermocycler.\n\n\n7.\nSet thermocycler with the following temperature conditions:StepTemperatureTimeNo. of cyclesInitial denaturation94\u00a0\u00b0C5\u00a0m1Denaturation94\u00a0\u00b0C30\u00a0s30Annealing56\u00a0\u00b0C30\u00a0sExtension72\u00a0\u00b0C5\u00a0mFinal extension72\u00a0\u00b0C10\u00a0m1Hold4\u00a0\u00b0C\u221e\u00a0\n\n\n8.\nPlace the reaction tubes in the thermocycler and run at the specified temperature conditions.\n\n\n9.\nAnalyze cPCR products by gel electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR\u00ae Safe gel staining and select potential positive candidates for sequencing based on the cPCR results.\n\n\n10.\nTo isolate the plasmids from the selected clones, prepare 50\u00a0mL conical tubes containing 5\u00a0mL LB broth supplemented with 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of ampicillin.\n\n\n11.\nRetrieve the LB plate containing grown copies of the screened clones. Using a sterile 10\u00a0\u03bcL pipette tip, pick the desired colony and inoculate the corresponding tube with LB broth.\n\n\n12.\nSet cultures to incubate overnight (~16\u00a0h) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/225\u00a0rpm in a shaker incubator.\n\n\n13.\nThe next day, pellet the bacterial cultures at 6800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g/3\u00a0min, discard the supernatant and proceed with plasmid purification using the QIAprep Spin Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions (see Note 10).\n\nThe purified plasmids are now ready for sequencing. In addition to cPCR screening, plasmids need to be sequenced to confirm the presence of unexpected mutations in either the gene segment or the plasmid vector, as well as the presence of a complete IAV or IBV gene segment and its orientation.3.7 Cell Culture Growth and MaintenanceIf cells have been kept in liquid nitrogen, perform fast thawing following source\u2019s instructions. For general growth and care, follow the recommendation listed below.\n\n1.\nAfter extracting a vial of cells from the liquid nitrogen, thaw quickly in 37\u00a0\u00b0C water bath.\n\n\n2.\nDispense the contents of the vial into a T25 flask containing pre-warmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1\u00d7 Penicillin/Streptomycin solution, 2\u00a0mM\u00a0l-Glutamine and 2.5% HEPES (complete media).\n\n\n3.\nPlace the cells into a cell culture incubator set at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2.\n\n\n4.\nWhen the cells have reached confluence (about 24\u201348\u00a0h), remove and discard the media.\n\n\n5.\nWash cells twice with 2\u00a0mL of pre-warmed, sterile 1\u00d7 PBS.\n\n\n6.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution and let incubate for 20\u201345\u00a0m (MDCK cells) or (PK-15 cells) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C (in the cell culture incubator) until the cells have completely detached. You may tap the sides of the flask to help with detachment.\n\n\n7.\nAdd an equal volume of complete media to stop the trypsinization and wash the bottom of the flask by pipetting up and down (see Note 11).\n\n\n8.\nPipette up and down a few times to resuspend the cells and transfer into a conical tube or appropriate size (15\u201350\u00a0mL).\n\n\n9.\nCentrifuge at 450\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n10.\nDiscard supernatant and add 5\u00a0mL of pre-warmed media and pipette up and down until cells have been resuspended. Adjust the volume to 13\u00a0mL with complete media.\n\n\n11.\nTransfer the cell resuspension to a T75 flask and rock to ensure even distribution of cells.\n\n\n12.\nPlace flask into the cell culture incubator under the same conditions as above.\n\n\n13.\nPass cells every 3\u00a0days following steps 4\u201310 but using 5\u00a0mL of 1\u00d7 PBS for the washes and 2\u20133\u00a0mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution for trypsinization.\n\n3.8 Rescue of IAV and IBV Using the Swine polI Reverse Genetics Plasmid  SetsBefore starting a transfection, it is recommended to prepare high quality plasmid preparations (see Note 10) using the HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi kit (QIAGEN) or other similar kit of your choice.The following procedure is very simple but also prone to cross-contamination if not careful. Use extreme care when handling cells, transfection reagents, plasmids, and media. The procedure described below is for performing transfections using a 6-well plate format and PK-15/MDCK cell co-cultures. It is also amenable for scaling down to 12- and 24-well plate formats (see Note 12).\n\n1.\nWash, treat with trypsin and pellet cells as described in Subheading 3.7.\n\n\n2.\nResuspend pelleted cells in 5\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM supplemented with 1\u00d7 antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Opti-MEM-AB/AM) and proceed to count manually or with an automated Cellometer.\n\n\n3.\nBased on cell count results, calculate the volume needed from each cell suspension to seed 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 PK-15 cells and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 MDCK cells/well (6-well plate). Bring co-culture cells suspension to a volume large enough to add 2\u00a0mL of cell suspension/well.\n\n\n4.\nRock plate(s) to evenly distribute cells in the wells and set to incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 overnight (~16\u201324\u00a0h).\n\n\n5.\nThe next day, when the co-cultures have reached ~80\u201390% confluency, prepare the cocktail of 8 plasmids (one plasmid per influenza viral RNA gene segment) in a 1.5\u00a0mL micro centrifuge tube. Please note that the use of filter tips is recommended for this and subsequent steps to avoid potential contaminations. If a working stock of each plasmid has been prepared at 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL, pipet 10\u00a0\u03bcL of each plasmid (1\u00a0\u03bcg of each plasmid, 8\u00a0\u03bcg pDNA) and set aside.\n\n\n6.\nIn a separate tube mix 104\u00a0\u03bcL of plain Opti-MEM and 16\u00a0\u03bcL of TransIT-LT1 (2\u00a0\u03bcL/\u03bcg of plasmid DNA). It is easier to calculate the total amount of Opti-MEM/ TransIT-LT1 needed for all the transfections and prepare a cocktail with the total volume (plus extra ~10% excess for both).\n\n\n7.\nVortex the Opti-MEM/TransIT-LT1 cocktail and add 120\u00a0\u03bcL to the plasmid DNA mixture and Mix well. It is essential to change tips before going into the next sample to avoid cross-contamination.\n\n\n8.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for approximately 45\u00a0m, and then, very slowly, add 800\u00a0\u03bcL of plain Opti-MEM. DO NOT mix.\n\n\n9.\nRemove the medium from the cells monolayers and add the transfection mixture to the corresponding wells. Washing the cells prior to addition of the transfection mixture is not necessary as no FBS was added to the seeding media. Use caution when adding transfection mixture onto the cells. It is best to place the pipet tip as close as possible to the cell monolayer and pipet down dropwise or deposit by the wall of the well to prevent aerosol formation.\n\n\n10.\nIncubate the cells for 6\u00a0h to overnight (~16\u00a0h) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 (35\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 for IBV).\n\n\n11.\nAfter incubation time has been completed, tilt the plate and carefully remove the transfection mixture from cells by positioning the pipette tip at the corner of the well where the liquid has accumulated. Discard in 10% bleach solution.\n\n\n12.\nThen, add 1\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM-AB/AM to the cells and incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 (35\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 for IBV) until 30\u00a0h post-transfection (hpt) have been completed.\n\n\n13.\nAt 30\u00a0hpt, add 1\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM-AB/AM containing 2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin to the each transfected well (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL final concentration per well).\n\n\n14.\nMonitor cells daily for cytopathic effect (CPE), particularly in the MDCK cells.

Add an additional 1\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM/AB/AM\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL final concentration per well) at 72\u00a0hpt if decided to prolong the incubation passing this time point.\n\n\n16.\nTo perform the blind passage, withdraw the cell culture supernatant into the appropriate centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 5000\u00a0rpm, at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, for 5\u00a0m.\n\n\n17.\nWithout disturbing the cell pellet, transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\n\n\n18.\nRemove the media from the MDCK cell monolayer and add 500\u00a0\u03bcL of cleared supernatant to the corresponding well.\n\n\n19.\nSet to incubate for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 (35\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 for IBV), rocking the plate every 15\u00a0m.\n\n\n20.\nNext, discard the supernatant and add 2\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM-AB/AM+1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin per well and monitor daily for CPE and/or HA assay at 48\u201372 hpi.\n\n\n21.\nCPE and/or HA positive samples can be either stored at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C for later or further propagated in either MDCK cells or 9\u201311-days old chicken embryonated eggs.\n\n3.9 Propagation of IAV and IBV in MDCK Cells\n\n\n1.\nThe day before infection, wash and treat MDCK cells with trypsin as described in Subheading 3.7. Resuspend cells with 10\u00a0mL of complete growth media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1\u00d7 Penicillin/Streptomycin solution, 2\u00a0mM\u00a0l-Glutamine and 2.5% HEPES).\n\n\n2.\nInto a new T75 Flask, add 2\u00a0mL of cell suspension and 10\u00a0mL of complete media.\n\n\n3.\nSet cells to incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 overnight (~16\u201324\u00a0h).\n\n\n4.\nOnce the cells have reached ~80\u201390% confluency, using plain Opti-MEM, make a 1/100 or 1/1000 from the IAV/IBV transfection or blind passage supernatant (from Subheading 3.8), based on the CPE severity and of HA titer.\n\n\n5.\nThen wash cells 2\u00d7 with 5\u00a0mL of 1\u00d7 PBS.\n\n\n6.\nNext, inoculate cells (in the T75 flask) with 2\u20133\u00a0mL of the IAV/IBV dilution and incubate for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 (35\u00a0\u00b0C/5% CO2 for IBV), rocking the flask\u00a0every 15\u00a0m.\n\n\n7.\nAfterwards, remove the inoculum and add 10\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM-AB/AM+1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin and monitor daily for CPE and/or HA assay at 48\u201372 hpi. CPE may start appearing at 48 hpi for IAV and 72 hpi for IBV. Incubation may be prolonged beyond 72 hpi (up to 120 hpi) if deemed appropriate in order to maximize the amount of virus recovered from the culture.\n\n\n8.\nDetermine the hemagglutination titer by performing HA assay as described on Subheading 3.10, steps 12\u201315.\n\n\n9.\nCollect the cell culture supernatant into a 15\u00a0mL conical tube and clear by centrifugation at 2500\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0m at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n10.\nTransfer the cleared supernatant into a new 15\u00a0mL conical tube (set in ice), homogenize by pipetting up and down, and prepare aliquots of the desired volume.\n\n\n11.\nStore aliquots at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n3.10 Propagation of IAV and IBV in  ECEs\n\n\n1.\nCandle embryos and mark the limit between the air chamber and the allantoid cavity.\n\n\n2.\nLabel eggs accordingly.\n\n\n3.\nPrepare tenfold dilutions of the virus starting by mixing 100\u00a0\u03bcL of transfection or blind passage supernatant (from Subheading 3.8) with 900\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7PBS (supplemented with 1\u00d7 antibiotic/antimycotic solution) and keep in ice until needed.\n\n\n4.\nDecontaminate eggshell with 70% ethanol or Ethanol/Iodine solution.\n\n\n5.\nDrill/ punch a hole on the shell a few millimeters (~3\u00a0mm) from the mark between the air chamber and the allantoid cavity.\n\n\n6.\nUsing 1\u00a0mL syringes with a\u00a0needle (25G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05/8\u2033), inoculate each dilution into 3\u20135\u00a0embryos (10\u22122 through 10\u22127), with 100\u00a0\u03bcL/embryo.\n\n\n7.\nSeal the hole with glue.\n\n\n8.\nSet embryos to incubate at 33\u00a0\u00b0C (IBV) or 35\u00a0\u00b0C (IAV) for 48\u00a0h candling daily to remove unspecific mortality. No virus-induced mortality is expected from embryos inoculated with low pathogenic IAV or IBV.\n\n\n9.\nOnce incubation has been completed, chill embryos overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n10.\nUsing 1\u00a0mL syringes with needle, collect 100\u00a0\u03bcL of allantoic fluid (AF) from each chilled embryo into tubes or a 96-well plate.\n\n\n11.\nPrepare 96-well V-bottom plates (as many as needed) by adding 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 PBS to each well.\n\n\n12.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL of AF to individual wells of column 1.\n\n\n13.\nPerform twofold dilutions from columns 1 through 12.\n\n\n14.\nNext, add 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 0.5% turkey red blood cells to each well.\n\n\n15.\nTap or shake the plate to homogenize and set to incubate for 45\u00a0min at room temperature.\n\n\n16.\nSelect the highest dilution at which all the inoculated embryos give the highest HA titer higher to avoid viral interfering particles.\n\n\n17.\nInto a single 50\u00a0mL conical tube (set in ice), collect as much AF as possible from each egg from the selected dilution.\n\n\n18.\nNext, clear the AF by centrifugation at 2500\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0m at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n19.\nTransfer the cleared AF into a new 50\u00a0mL conical tube (set in ice), homogenize by pipetting up and down, and prepare aliquots of the desired volume.\n\n\n20.\nStore aliquots at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n4 Notes\n\n\n1.\nOther ambisense/bidirectional plasmids, such as pDZ [33] or pHW2000 [24], can be used for reverse genetics of IAVs with appropriate amplification primers.\n\n\n2.\nAlternatively, MDCK/human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) co-cultures could be used for the rescue of influenza viruses when using the spol I reverse genetics system. However, HEK293T are not an approved cell line for vaccine development. In addition, HEK293T cells are less efficient for the rescue of IAV and IBV when employing the spol I reverse genetics system [29].\n\n\n3.\nDedicated equipment, supplies, and reagents solely for RNA work is highly recommended. Disposable gloves must be worn at all times while performing the RNA extraction procedure and while handling RNA samples to avoid RNA degradation. Extracted RNA samples should be kept on ice at all times and, preferably, be used immediately for cDNA synthesis. Remaining RNA can be kept frozen at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C. Typically, RNA samples stored for more than a month are not reliable and are to be discarded. Consult the Kit\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s instructions for more details about storage.\n\n\n4.\nThe vRNAs are extracted using silica-based (i.e., QiAmp Viral RNA kit) or organic-based (TRIzol reagent, Invitrogen) reagents or any other available RNA extraction method following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent is preferred when extracting RNA from samples with low viral loads. We recommend the QiAmp Viral RNA kit, which has provided consistent and reliable results, with adequate vRNA purity and devoid of contaminants and ribonucleases. Viral titers of \u2265106 TCID50 (\u2265107 EID50) are typically required for efficient preparation of vRNAs and subsequent RT-PCR amplification. Virus isolation from clinical samples, tissue cultured MDCK cells or 9- to 11-days-old chicken embryonated eggs are recommended in order to obtain appropriate quantities of vRNA for downstream procedures. Extracted vRNAs are eluted and resuspended in RNase-free ddH2O. RNA concentration is quantified using a NanoDrop or similar spectrophotometer.\n\n\n5.\nSynthesis of cDNA can be performed using other reverse transcriptase following manufacturer\u2019s directions. The PCR amplification step is crucial; the use of other thermophilic DNA polymerase enzymes is possible but those mentioned above have provided the most robust results.\n\n\n6.\nFor optimal amplification of IAV and IBV segments, use an extension time of 5\u00a0m when amplifying the NP, NA, M, and NS gene segments. When amplifying the PB2, PB1, PA, and HA genes, use an extension time of 7\u00a0m.\n\n\n7.\nIf using a water bath, please note the potential for excessive evaporation resulting from prolonged incubation periods.\n\n\n8.\nThe recommended insert/vector ratio for the ligation reaction depends on the size of both the insert ant the vector. When the vector is larger than the insert, a 3:1 ratio is recommended. If the insert is of equal or larger size than the vector a 1:1 ratio would be more appropriate.\n\n\n9.\nThe final volume of the ligation reaction can be adjusted if the vector and/or insert concentrations are too low that require the use of larger volumes. Just scale up the rection buffer and scale down the nuclease-free water volumes accordingly to maintain the proper concentrations in the reaction.\n\n\n10.\nPlasmids are purified using commercially available plasmid preparation kits, following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, and are best stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C at a concentration of 0.25\u20131.0\u00a0mg/mL. It is recommended to prepare high quality plasmids preparation for transfection experiments as impurities may interfere with the transfection efficiency. Measure DNA and RNA concentrations at an absorbance of 260\u00a0nm using a Nanodrop or similar spectrophotometer. The 260/280 ratio is used to estimate sample purity. A plasmid preparation with a 260/280\u00a0nm ratio of \u22651.8 is highly recommended. We also recommend that plasmid stocks are diluted into working stocks at a concentration of 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL prior to transfection to minimize pipetting errors and to standardize pipetting volumes for each plasmid. The integrity of the plasmid DNA should be assessed by electrophoresis in agarose gels before each transfection.\n\n\n11.\nThe minimum volume of complete media to be added to stop the trypsinization has to equal the volume of trypsin that was added. One can always add more trypsin to ensure proper wash of the attachment surface and decrease bubble and foam formation.\n\n\n12.\nAlthough transfection can be performed in smaller well plate formats, the efficiency of virus rescue decreases with smaller wells due to the fewer number of cells susceptible for transfection."}
{"text": "Reverse Genetics with a Full-Length Infectious cDNA Clone of Bovine Torovirus. \n ABSTRACT \n Historically part of the coronavirus (CoV) family, torovirus (ToV) was recently classified in the new family Tobaniviridae. While reverse genetics systems have been established for various CoVs, none exist for ToVs. Here, we developed a reverse genetics system using an infectious full-length cDNA clone of bovine ToV (BToV) in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Recombinant BToV harboring genetic markers had the same phenotype as wild-type (wt) BToV. To generate two types of recombinant virus, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene was edited, as cell-adapted wtBToV generally loses full-length HE (HEf), resulting in soluble HE (HEs). First, recombinant viruses with HEf and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HEf or HEs genes were rescued. These exhibited no significant differences in their effect on virus growth in HRT18 cells, suggesting that HE is not essential for viral replication in these cells. Thereafter, we generated a recombinant virus (rEGFP) wherein HE was replaced by the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene. rEGFP expressed EGFP in infected cells but showed significantly lower levels of viral growth than wtBToV. Moreover, rEGFP readily deleted the EGFP gene after one passage. Interestingly, rEGFP variants with two mutations (C1442F and I3562T) in nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that emerged during passage exhibited improved EGFP expression, EGFP gene retention, and viral replication. An rEGFP into which both mutations were introduced displayed a phenotype similar to that of these variants, suggesting that the mutations contributed to EGFP gene acceptance. The current findings provide new insights into BToV, and reverse genetics will help advance the current understanding of this neglected pathogen.IMPORTANCE ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens detected in various species, including humans. Through the development of a BAC-based BToV, we introduced the first reverse genetics system for Tobaniviridae. Utilizing this system, recombinant BToVs with a full-length HE gene were generated. Remarkably, although clinical BToVs generally lose the HE gene after a few passages, some recombinant viruses generated in the current study retained the HE gene for up to 20 passages while accumulating mutations in NSPs, which suggested that these mutations may be involved in HE gene retention. The EGFP gene of recombinant viruses was unstable, but rEGFP into which two NSP mutations were introduced exhibited improved EGFP expression, gene retention, and viral replication. These data suggested the existence of an NSP-based acceptance or retention mechanism for exogenous RNA or HE genes. Recombinant BToVs and reverse genetics are powerful tools for understanding fundamental viral processes, pathogenesis, and BToV vaccine development.INTRODUCTIONTorovirus (ToV), which currently belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Tobaniviridae, subfamily Torovirinae, and genus Torovirus, historically used to be part of the family Coronaviridae (1). ToVs are causative agents of diarrheic as well as respiratory diseases and have been detected in various species, including bovines, equines, swine, goats, and humans (2\u20136). Although ToV infections are generally asymptomatic or do not have severe symptoms, bovine ToV (BToV) (7\u201316) and porcine ToV (PToV) (17\u201322) are globally widespread, causing economic losses. Inter- and intrarecombination are frequently observed among ToVs, potentially enhancing their pathogenicity or facilitating unpredicted host adaptation (23\u201328). Despite the threat that ToVs pose as pathogens, at present there are no drugs or vaccines available for the treatment and prevention of ToV infection.ToV and coronavirus (CoV) are structurally and morphologically similar (5, 6, 29\u201332). Both are enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses with genomes of 25 to 32 kb, primarily composed of six conserved open reading frames (ORFs). The first two-thirds of the genome contain ORF1a and ORF1b, with an overlap due to a frameshift, encoding the replicase/transcriptase proteins (32\u201335). The remaining one-third of the genome mainly encodes structural and accessory proteins. ToVs are composed of four structural proteins, namely, the spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (12, 29, 32, 36\u201341), while the CoV virion consists of S, M, N, and envelope (E) proteins (34, 42\u201345), with some beta-CoVs also encoding an HE protein (26). ToV lacks the E protein, which plays an important role in CoV assembly (46, 47).The HE protein of ToVs and some CoVs is a type I glycoprotein on the viral envelope with two functional domains, one of which binds O-acetylated sialic acids (O-Ac-Sia), while the other destroys these binding interactions (26). Since O-Ac-Sias can act as a cell attachment factor or functional receptor for ToV and CoV, the receptor-destroying activity of HE is believed to promote the release of viral progeny from infected cells as well as to prevent attachment to nonpermissive cells or self-aggregation (26). As most HE genes are strictly maintained in field strains, HE proteins must benefit viral replication under field conditions.However, in cultured cells, the roles of the HE protein differ significantly between virus species. Among beta-CoVs, HCoV-OC43 uses O-Ac-Sias as the principal receptor (48, 49), binding to it via both the S and HE proteins. In this case, the receptor-destroying activity of HCoV-OC43 HE is essential for the efficient release of progeny viruses from infected cells (50). In contrast, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S protein interacts with the murine carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CAECAM1a) as the principal receptor (51), while HE binds to O-Ac-Sias exclusively, meaning that MHV does not require HE proteins for viral propagation (52). In fact, various cell-adapted laboratory strains of MHV fail to produce HE (53), and MHV rapidly loses it during serial passages (54, 55).Similar observations have been made in ToVs. Berne virus is the first cell-adapted strain isolated from horses (6). It lost the HE gene and thus fails to produce HE protein (56, 57). Although ToVs other than the Berne virus have long been difficult to isolate from cultured cells, several BToVs in Japan were successfully isolated and propagated from human rectal tumor-18 (HRT18) cells in the last 15\u2009years (23, 58\u201361). BToV harboring the full-length HE gene was initially isolated from diarrheal feces, whereas cell-adapted BToV generally loses full-length HE due to a stop codon insertion occurring after several passages (59\u201361). This finding suggests that the HE protein is not essential for viral replication in cultured cells and may even suppress it. Further, HE can also be regarded as an accessory protein. Taken together, these data indicate that the role of the ToV HE protein in cultured cells remains elusive.While ToVs historically belonged to the CoV family, only a few studies have focused on ToVs compared to the extensive research on CoVs. The CoVs are mainly associated with respiratory and enteric diseases and are regarded as important pathogens in both humans and animals. Among human CoVs, in addition to four species causing mild upper respiratory disease (62), three novel life-threating CoVs that cause acute lung injury have emerged during the 21st century, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003 (63, 64), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (65), and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 (66, 67). In animals, some CoVs cause severe or lethal diseases in swine (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [PEDV] and transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]), bovine (bovine CoV), avian (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]), mouse (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]), and feline (feline infectious peritonitis virus [FIPV]) species. CoVs have been extensively studied, and reverse genetics systems have been established for many CoV species, including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (68\u201393). Currently, four reverse genetics systems are available, namely, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (83), in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments (84), vaccinia vector with full-length CoV cDNA (82), and the recently developed transformation-associated recombination cloning into yeast artificial chromosome systems (69). Using these systems, recombinant viruses carrying reporter genes, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase genes, have been generated by replacing accessory genes (69, 85\u201387, 92). Reverse genetics systems and recombinant viruses harboring reporter genes are useful tools for studying fundamental viral processes, infection pathogenesis, vaccine development, and screening therapeutic compounds.In contrast to CoVs, no reverse genetics systems have been established for ToVs due to an overall lower interest in these species. In the present study, we describe a reverse genetics system for BToV based on the cloning of a full-length genomic cDNA into a BAC. Using this system, two types of recombinant BToVs were rescued. To assess stability of the full-length HE gene and study the role of HE in cultured cells, recombinant BToVs with an HA-tagged or untagged full-length HE gene were generated. Next, a recombinant reporter gene-carrying BToV was generated by replacing the HE gene with an EGFP gene, as BToVs do not contain an accessory gene other than the HE gene. The recombinant BToVs were subsequently characterized.RESULTSConstruction of a full-length BToV genome in a BAC.To determine the parental BToV (Aichi strain) for reverse genetics, the full-length genomic sequences of three plaque-purified BToVs were analyzed. We tried to determine the 5\u2032 ends of these viruses via the 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method, but several different sequences were observed in the three terminal bases: 5\u2032-TGACGT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-GTACGT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-GGACGT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-GACGT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-ACGT-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-(\u2013)CGT-3\u2032. The sequences at the 5\u2032 ends of three published BToVs (23, 33) and two published PToVs (accession numbers JQ860350 and KM403390) were all 5\u2032-TGACGT-3\u2032, whereas equine ToV harbored 5\u2032-ACGT-3\u2032 (94). Whether these differences in our study of BToVs were due to the intrinsic features of the virus or suboptimal experimental conditions during the 5\u2032 RACE method remains unclear. Nevertheless, 5\u2032-TGACGT-3\u2032 from published BToVs and PToVs was found in only one of seven BToVs in our analysis, whereas 5\u2032-ACGT-3\u2032, reported in equine BToV, is a consensus sequence. Thus, in the current study, the sequence at the 5\u2032 end of BToV was set as 5\u2032-ACGT-3\u2032. Two BToV clones showed the same sequence, and one of these was selected as the parental virus (wtBToV).Full-length BToV genome cDNA was assembled into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid carrying a cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (Rz), and bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination. The cDNA was inserted downstream of the CMV promoter and was flanked by a 25-poly(A) sequence. The BToV genomic cDNA was amplified into eight PCR fragments (BToV-A to -H) carrying homology arms (hms) at both termini, and these were sequentially assembled (Fig. 1A) via the Red/ET recombination method described in Materials and Methods (Fig. 1B). After assembly of the eight fragments, the BAC carrying the full-length BToV genome cDNA (pBAC-BToVmut1) contained two single mutations at nucleotides G3399T and T8469G. Moreover, the 1,350-bp Escherichia coli chromosome-derived sequence was inserted at nucleotide 10,136, likely to counter the regions toxic to bacteria, which are observed in some CoVs (79, 84) (Fig. 2A). These two single mutations and the E. coli sequence were reverted or deleted as described in Materials and Methods (pBAC-BToVpre) (Fig. 2A).FIG 1FIG 1 Assembly of full-length BToV cDNA into a BAC and flowchart of Red/ET recombination. (A) The genome sequence of BToV is divided into eight fragments (BToV-A to -H), and each fragment contained homology arms (hms) overlapping each fragment at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends (vertical dashed line). To distinguish the base number between the BToV genome and BAC, the number in the BToV genome of 28,313\u2009nt without poly(A) (25\u2009nt) is given without parentheses, while the number in the BAC of 8,219\u2009bp is in parentheses, starting with the CMV promoter. (B) (i) E. coli carrying the BAC was electroporated with the pRed/ET plasmid, and the Red/ET recombinant enzyme was induced with l-arabinose. (ii) The linear rpsL/Neo counterselection/selection cassette flanked by hms was electroporated, and the Red/ET enzyme inserted the rpsL/Neo cassette into the target position via hms. (iii) After selection of appropriate antibodies, the Red/ET enzyme in E. coli carrying the modified BAC could replace the rpsL/Neo cassette with the cDNA fragment of BToV in the same manner. Only E. coli carrying BAC with the target cDNA fragment could be selected by antibodies and 37\u00b0C, the temperature at which the pRed/ET plasmid was removed.FIG 2FIG 2 Schematic diagram of the pBAC-BToV construction strategy. (A) (i) BAC-BToVmut1 contained two mutations at nucleotides 3399 (E\u2192D) and 8469 (silent), an E. coli chromosomal insertion at 10136, and two SapI sites at (4526) and (5736) on the BAC. Two mutations were reverted via the pRed/ET recombination method. To remove the E. coli-derived sequence, two SapI sites on the BAC were removed via a single nucleotide substitution of the recognition site (which is shown below) using in vitro recombination. (ii) The SapI recognition sites (one is in the reverse direction) were inserted on both sides of the E. coli-derived sequence via pRed/ET recombination. (iii) Finally, the resulting BAC plasmid (pBAC-BToVmut2) was treated with SapI and subjected to in vitro self-ligation (pBAC-BToVpre). (B) To introduce genetic markers of pBAC-BToVpre, an rpsL/Neo cassette was inserted between nucleotides 26249 and 28150, containing partial M, HE, and N genes, via hms (pBAC-BToVHE/N-rpsL/Neo). The rpsL/Neo cassette was replaced with HE carrying the genetic makers at nucleotides 26530 and 26554, with the surrounding sequence via hms (pBAC-BToV).Rescue of recombinant BToV.To distinguish between the parental wtBToV and recombinant wtBToV (rBToV) generated from the BAC plasmid, two gene markers were inserted into the HE gene at nucleotides T26530C and T26554A (both silent) (pBAC-BToV) (Fig. 2B). pBAC-BToV was first transfected into nonpermissive 293T, COS7, BHK, Vero, and Huh7 cells because of the very low transfection efficiency in permissive HRT18 cells. Of these cells, 293T exhibited the best virus production with no clear cytopathic effect (CPE), and the viral titer of the supernatant 3\u2009days posttransfection (dpt) averaged 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009104.1 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/mL (n\u2009=\u20093). The supernatant from transfected 293T cells was inoculated into permissive HRT18 cells, whereafter the virus was plaque purified three times; the purified virus was then expanded and used to characterize its phenotype. CPE and plaque morphology induced or formed by rBToV were identical to those for parental wtBToV (Fig. 3B and 4A). Comparison of the full-length genome sequences between rBToV and wtBToV showed complete sequence identity except for two gene markers (Fig. 3C). In order to compare growth kinetics between rBToV and wtBToV, HRT18 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, and supernatants were harvested at the indicated times. rBToV and wtBToV had indistinguishable growth properties in HRT18 cells and peak titers of >1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106.4 TCID50/mL at 48 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 4D). All these data indicated that an infectious full-length cDNA clone of BToV was successfully constructed in the BAC system, with the rBToV and parental wtBToV having the same phenotypic properties in HRT18 cells.FIG 3FIG 3 Schematic diagram and generation of recombinant BToVs. (A) Cell-adapted wtBToV lost full-length HE (HEf; 419 aa) due to a stop codon at nucleotide 481 (base number of the HE gene), resulting in the soluble form HE (HEs; 160 aa). rHEs/HA and rHEf/HA were added to the HA tag at the C terminus of HEs and HEf proteins, respectively. rEGFP carries a reporter EGFP gene in which the HE gene was completely replaced.

(B) (Top) Detection of the membrane (M), HE, and HA-tagged proteins of recombinant BToVs via indirect immunofluorescence. HRT18 cells were infected with these viruses at an MOI of 0.05, and infected cells were fixed, permeabilized at 24 hpi, and then stained with mouse anti-M and anti-HE antiserum or rabbit anti-HA antibodies and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (green). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Stained cells were observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope. (Bottom) \u03b1-NA esterase activity of the cells infected with recombinant BToVs.

Proteins were detected with rabbit anti-N antiserum and mouse-anti-HA 12CA5 antibody for HEf/HA and rabbit anti-HA antibody for HEs/HA. (D) Growth kinetics of recombinant BToVs. HRT18A cells were infected with an MOI of 0.001. At the indicated times, supernatants of infected cells were harvested, and virus titers were determined as TCID50. The means and standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown (n\u2009=\u20093). The dashed line shows the detection limit. N.D, not detected.Characterization of recombinant BToV with full-length HE or HA-tagged HE.BToVs initially isolated from clinical samples had full-length HE (HEf) genes, but the cell-adapted wtBToV has a stop codon at nucleotide 481 (base number of the HE gene), CAG (Q)\u2192TAG (stop), resulting in soluble HE (HEs), 160 amino acids (aa) in length (Fig. 3A). To investigate HE gene stability and the effect of the HE protein on viral growth in HRT18 cells, recombinant BToVs with HEf, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HEf, and HA-tagged HEs genes were generated (designated rHEf, rHEf/HA, and rHEs/HA, while rBToV was designated rHEs) (Fig. 3A). All these recombinant BToVs were successfully rescued and purified via the method described for rBToV. They exhibited no significant differences in plaque morphology and CPEs (data not shown) in HRT18 cells compared to parental wtBToV and rBToV (rHEs) (Fig. 4A).To detect HE proteins or esterase activity, HRT18 cells infected with recombinant BToVs were fixed at 24 hpi and then subjected to an \u03b1-naphthyl acetate (\u03b1-NA) esterase assay or to indirect immunofluorescence (IF) assay using mouse anti-HE and anti-M antiserum. M proteins were detected similarly in all infected cells, whereas HE proteins and \u03b1-NA esterase activity were observed only in cells infected with rHEf and rHEf/HA, indicating that recombinant virus carrying the full-length HE gene expressed a functional HE protein in infected cells (Fig. 4B). HA-tagged proteins showed different reactivity when rabbit anti-HA or mouse anti-HA 12CA5 antibodies were used, depending on experimental conditions. In IF assays, the HEs/HA proteins were well stained by both anti-HA antibodies (only rabbit anti-HA is shown), whereas the HEf/HA protein was barely or not stained (Fig. 4B). However, in COS7 cells transiently expressing HA-tagged proteins, both HEs/HA and HEf/HA proteins were stained via the two antibodies (data not shown).In immunoblotting using two anti-HA antibodies and rabbit anti-N antiserum, N proteins were detected similarly in all infected cells (Fig. 4C). HEs/HA could be detected with both anti-HA antibodies, similar to IF results, whereas HEf/HA could be detected only with the mouse anti-HA 12CA5 antibody. It is unclear whether the different reactivity is due to modification by viral infection, antibody properties, or protein expression levels, but the HA tag at the C terminus of HEf/HA may form a specific structure that affects the reactivity of the anti-HA antibodies. Finally, the growth kinetics of these recombinant BToVs were compared. All recombinant BToVs, wtBToV, and rBToV (rHEs) exhibited no significant differences in growth properties (Fig. 4D). These results indicated that recombinant BToVs could express full-length HE and HA-tagged proteins in infected cells with a growth ability comparable to those of the parental wtBToV and rBToV (rHEs).Full-length HE gene stability of rHEf and rHEf/HA.To assess the stability of the full-length HE gene of rHEf and rHEf/HA, HRT18 cells were infected with two clones (clones 1 and 2) derived from different plaques of each virus, and viruses were serially passaged until 20 passages (P20). Cells were infected with the viruses harvested at the indicated passage, fixed or lysed at 24 hpi, and then subjected to either an \u03b1-NA esterase assay or N protein detection via immunoblotting (Fig. 5A and B). N proteins were detected in all infected cells (Fig. 5B). Cells infected with rHEf clone 2 and rHEf/HA clones 1 and 2 exhibited \u03b1-NA esterase activity until P19, whereas cells infected with rHEf clone 1 exhibited gradually decreasing activity during passages, which was completely lost at P19 (Fig. 5A). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of the supernatants from infected cells (resulting in +1 passage) using primers flanking the HE gene indicated that, during serial passages, the band sizes of rHEf clone 1 without esterase activity and rHEf clone 2 with esterase activity were not different (Fig. 5C). In contrast, although both rHEf/HA exhibited esterase activity, a smaller band was observed in rHEf/HA clone 2 from P10.FIG 5FIG 5 Full-length HE gene stability of recombinant HE mutant BToVs. (A) \u03b1-NA esterase activity of infected cells with recombinant BToVs carrying full-length HE gene during serial passages. HRT18 cells in a 24-well plate infected at an MOI of 0.05 were fixed at 24 hpi and then tested for \u03b1-NA esterase activity. Two clones (clone 1 and clone 2) derived from different plaques of each virus were used. (B) Immunoblotting of N proteins in HRT18 cells infected with recombinant BToVs described above at the indicated passage. (C) RT-PCR of the HE gene of recombinant BToVs. The supernatant from infected cells (resulting in +1 passage) was amplified via RT-PCR using primers flanking the HE gene (shown in panel D, 1,670\u2009bp). Amplicons were analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis. (D) Sequencing analysis results summary of recombinant BToVs HE genes. Viruses at P19 were plaque purified once, six well-isolated plaques were selected, and then these viruses were inoculated into fresh HRT18 cells. The HE gene was amplified from each supernatant and sequenced. The ratios show the number of plaques that had the HE protein described/total.To further study HE genes, all these viruses at P19 were plaque purified once, and the HE genes of viruses from six well-isolated plaques were sequenced. As summarized in Fig. 5D and Table 1, all six rHEf clone 1 sequences had one base deletion at nt T19 in the HE gene, resulting in a 17-aa short peptide with a stop codon by \u22121 frameshifting, and three of six had an additional deletion between nucleotides 1216 and 1241 (representative plaques were designated c61 and c62, respectively, in Table 1). In contrast, all six rHEf clone 2 retained the full-length HE gene (representative plaque; c77), and one of six had an amino acid substitution at T321I in the HE protein. Of the six, five rHEf/HA clones 1 retained the HA-tagged full-length HE gene (representative plaque, c81), but one had an amino acid mutation within the HA tag (YPYDYPDYA\u2192YLYDYPDYA). Further, three rHEf/HA clone 2 retained the HA-tagged full-length HE gene (representative plaque, c92), one of which having a D247E substitution in the HE protein, while the other three had a deletion between nt 278 to nt 878, causing a short soluble HE protein, 99 aa in length (representative plaque, c91). These data partly supported the idea that HE proteins are not essential or could have a negative effect on virus growth in HRT18 cells. However, it should be noted that some rHAf and rHEf/HA could retain the full-length HE gene for up to at least 20 passages. These findings were unexpected, as another BToV (Niigata strain), which was isolated from a clinical sample and purified by limited dilution, usually lost the HE gene after a few cell passages.TABLE 1TABLE 1 Amino acid mutations of recombinant BToVs with or without full-length HE genes after 20 passagesVirusClonePlaqueHEMutation(s) in:HE genea5\u2032 UTRaNSP1NSP4NSP6NSP9NSP10NSP11SrHEf1c61HE, truncated1del (at 19 nt)\u00a0\u00a0T3455I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T6025IA57S\u00a01c62HE, truncated1del (at 19 nt), 1216\u20131241delC215T\u00a0T3455I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A57S\u00a02c77HE, full\u00a0T304CF1344V, I1464V\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0G5337V, A5663V\u00a0T115KrHEf/HA1c81HE/HA, full\u00a0\u00a0C1262F, H1342Y, L1445P, I2267T\u00a0\u00a0R4324C\u00a0\u00a0E880V\u00a02c91HE/HA, truncated278\u2013878del\u00a0\u00a0S3520G\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0P1399S\u00a02c92HE/HA, full\u00a0\u00a0S1364R\u00a0D3892E\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A57SaMutations within the 5\u2032 UTR and HE gene are shown with nucleotide (nt) numbers. All others are shown with amino acid numbers in NSP polypeptide and S protein, respectively.To further investigate the virus that can retain the full HE gene after 20 passages (P20 virus), a growth kinetics experiment and full-length genome sequencing of the representative plaque-purified P20 viruses were carried out. Growth kinetics comparison indicated that the titers of P20 viruses with or without the HE gene were more than four times higher than those of parental P0 viruses (rHEf or rHEf/HA) at 24 hpi, suggesting that all P20 viruses had gained an ability to grow faster than parental viruses during cell adaptation (Fig. 6). In addition, the titers of P20 viruses with a full HE gene (c77, c81, and c92) tended to be higher than those of parental P0 viruses at 48 hpi and 72 hpi. The titers of P20 viruses without a full HE gene (c61, c62, and c91) tended to be similar to that of P0 parental viruses at 48 hpi and lower at 72 hpi. Genome sequencing revealed no common mutation exclusive to the three P20 viruses with a full HE gene, but they harbored mutations in very close locations within NSP1 (H1342Y, F1344V, and S1364R, respectively). Further, two of them had additional close mutations (L1445P and I1464V) in NSP1 (Table 1). It should be noted that the latter positions, especially L1445P, are very close to C1442F, which is one of the mutations involved in exogenous EGFP gene acceptance described below. The current findings suggested that these mutations in NSP1 may be involved in HE retention and that some viruses can adapt to cells while retaining the HE gene.FIG 6FIG 6 Growth kinetics of recombinant BToVs with or without full-length HE genes after 20 passages. HRT18B cells were infected at an MOI of 0.001. The virus titers were determined as described for Fig. 4. Plus and minus signs after the virus names indicate the presence and absence of the full-length HE gene, respectively. Mean and standard deviations from five independent experiments are shown (n\u2009=\u20095). The dashed line shows the detection limit. N.D, not detected.Influence of HE protein complementation on infectious recombinant BToV production.As the titers of P20 viruses retaining the full HE gene tended to be higher than those of parental P0 viruses and even P20 viruses without the HE gene, it was suggested that although the HE gene is unstable, its protein product may confer some benefit to virus growth in cultured cells. To study whether HE protein complementation affects the production of infectious recombinant BToVs, 293T cells were cotransfected with pBAC-BToV or pBAC-BToV-HEf, along with pCAGGS-HEs, -HEf, -HEs/HA, and -HEf/HA, which are vectors expressing the wtHE (HEs) or mutant HE proteins. The transfected cells were subjected to HA-tagged protein detection via immunoblotting, \u03b1-NA esterase assay, and N protein detection via IF. The HA-tagged proteins were detected in the cells cotransfected with pCAGGS-HEs/HA and -HEf/HA, while \u03b1-NA esterase activity was observed in cells cotransfected with pCAGGS-HEf and -HEf/HA (Fig. 7A and B). In contrast, the proteins derived from pBACs, that is, from recombinant BToVs, could not be detected via immunoblotting for the N protein (data not shown), with no \u03b1-NA esterase activity detected either (rHEf in Fig. 7B). This may be due to the low virus production in 293T cells being below the limit of detection. Although there were very few cells, N proteins derived from recombinant BToVs could be clearly detected in all samples via IF (Fig. 7C). Finally, the viral titers were compared between supernatants (Fig. 7D). Both rHEs and rHEf exhibited the highest titers when no vector was cotransfected. In the cotransfection with an expression vector, the viral titer tended to be higher when the HEf or HEf/HA were cotransfected, but there were no statistically significant differences between samples. These data suggested that HE protein complementation did not have a significant negative or positive effect on the production of infectious recombinant BToVs in 293T cells.FIG 7FIG 7 HE complementation assay of recombinant BToVs. 293T cells were cotransfected with pBAC-BToV or pBAC-BToV-HEf along with pCAGGS, pCAGGS-HEs, pCAGGS-HEf, pCAGGS-HEs/HA, and pCAGGS-HEf/HA. After 3 dpt, the cells were subjected to (A) immunoblotting of HA-tagged proteins, (B) \u03b1-NA esterase activity assays, and (C) immunofluorescence staining using mouse anti-N antiserum, as described in Materials and Methods. (D) Virus titers in the supernatant were determined as TCID50. The means and standard deviations from four independent experiments are shown (n\u2009=\u20094).Characterization of recombinant BToV carrying the EGFP gene.We then attempted to generate recombinant BToV, wherein the HE gene was replaced with an EGFP gene (rEGFP) (Fig. 3A). rEGFPs were first generated by the plaque-purified method described above; however, due to EGFP gene instability as described below, two rEGFP clones (clone 1 and clone 2) derived from different plaques had already shown a partial lack of the EGFP gene during the process of plaque purification. Thus, to retain the EGFP gene, other rEGFPs were generated without plaque purification as described in Materials and Methods, and clones 3 to 6 were assigned to rEGFPs obtained from independent experiments. As a result, unpurified rEGFPs (clone 3 to clone 6) could relatively retain the EGFP gene compared to plaque-purified rEGFPs (clone 1 and clone 2) (see Fig. 9B, P0 viruses). Therefore, unpurified rEGFPs were primarily used in this study. All rEGFPs formed smaller and more heterogeneous plaques than the parent wtBToV (Fig. 8A).FIG 8FIG 8 Growth and characteristics of recombinant BToV carrying the EGFP gene. (A) Representative image of plaque morphology of rEGFP at 3\u2009dpi. For rEGFP, plaque purification of some recombinant viruses was omitted because of EGFP gene instability. Clones 1 and 2 were plaque purified, while clones 3 to 6 were not purified. These recombinant viruses were expanded and then stored as P0 virus. (B) Detection of EGFP expression (green) in infected cells with rEGFP with a fluorescence microscope. HRT18 cells were infected with rEGFP clone 3 at an MOI of 0.05, and infected cells were stained with Hoechst (blue) at 36 hpi. Living infected cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope (left). Infected cells were fixed at 36 hpi, permeabilized, stained with mouse anti-M antiserum and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (red), and observed via confocal laser-scanning microscopy (right). Cells infected with rBToV and wtBToV were observed or fixed at 24 hpi. (C) Immunoblotting of EGFP and N proteins in infected cells with rEGFP. The infected cells described above were lysed at 36 hpi. Cells infected with rBToV and wtBToV were lysed at 24 hpi. Proteins in the lysates were detected with rabbit anti-N antiserum and mouse anti-GFP antibody. (D) Growth kinetics of rEGFP clone 3. HRT18A cells were infected at an MOI of 0.001. Virus titers were determined as described for Fig. 4. Each result of four independent experiments of rEGFP clone 3 is shown. The dashed line shows the detection limit. N.D, not detected.To detect EGFP, infected cells at 36 hpi were observed under a fluorescence microscope or fixed, permeabilized, stained with mouse anti-M antiserum, and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fig. 8B). EGFP expression was observed only in cells infected with rEGFP and not in those infected with wtBToV or rBToV, with EGFP-expressing cells always expressing the M protein as well (Fig. 8B). These infected cells were subjected to N protein and EGFP detection via immunoblotting. Although the amount of N protein in the rEGFP-infected cells was significantly lower than that in cells infected with wtBToV and rBToV, EGFP was detected only in rEGFP-infected cells (Fig. 8C). Comparison of the growth kinetics between rEGFP, wtBToV, and rBToV revealed that rEGFP had significantly lower growth ability. In four independent experiments, no virus could be detected at 24 hpi, and peak titers of 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009103.8 to 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009104.6 TCID50/mL were observed at 48 to 72 hpi in three experiments, which decreased by >2 log compared to those of parental viruses (Fig. 8D). In one experiment, the peak titer reached 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106.6 TCID50/mL at 72 hpi, but the virus no longer expressed EGFP (Fig. 8D). These data indicated that rEGFP could express EGFP in infected cells but its growth properties significantly decreased. Moreover, rEGFP seemed to readily lose EGFP expression during virus growth.To assess EGFP gene stability, HRT18 cells were infected with rEGFP, and viruses were serially passaged until P5. Cells were infected with rEGFP harvested at the indicated passage history and were studied under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 9A). As a result, EGFP was not observed in most of the cells infected with rEGFP (clone 1 to clone 4) after one passage. RT-PCR of P0 and P1 viruses using primers flanking the EGFP gene revealed that rEGFP P0 predominantly harbored the full-length EGFP gene, but smaller bands were observed in all rEGFP P1 (clones 1 to 4) (Fig. 9B). Of these, the major bands of rEGFP P1 (clones 2 to 4) were analyzed, and it was found that a large part of the EGFP gene was absent (Fig. 9D). This result suggested that rEGFP readily lost EGFP expression due to deletion of the EGFP gene after one passage.FIG 9FIG 9 EGFP gene stability of rEGFP. (A) EGFP expression of rEGFP during serial passages. HRT18 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.001, and then 1,000-fold-diluted virus was inoculated into fresh cells. Viruses were then harvested after 2 to 3\u2009dpi. Cells were infected with 1,000-fold diluted rEGFP harvested at the indicated passage history and observed at 36 hpi with a fluorescence microscope. For P0 viruses, cells infected at an MOI of 0.05 (actual experiment was 0.001) clearly exhibit EGFP expression. (B) RT-PCR of the EGFP gene of rEGFP. The supernatant viruses from infected cells (+1 passage) were analyzed via RT-PCR using primers flanking the EGFP gene (D; 1,130\u2009bp). Amplicons were analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis. (C) Immunoblotting of EGFP and N proteins in cells infected with rEGFP clone 5 at the indicated passage history. Cells were infected with 1,000-fold-diluted rEGFP clone 5 from P1 and infected with P0 viruses (rEGFP clone 5, rBToV, and wtBToV) at an MOI of 0.05. Cells infected with rBToV or wtBToV were lysed at 24 hpi, and those infected with rEGFP clone 5 were lysed at 36 hpi. (D) Summary of EGFP gene sequencing analysis for rEGFP. Major bands of the EGFP gene from each supernatant were purified and sequenced.Improvement of EGFP expression and growth properties in rEGFP variant.Interestingly, rEGFP clones 5 and 6 maintained the EGFP gene after one passage. Clone 6 exhibited gradually decreasing EGFP expression until P5, while that of clone 5 appeared to gradually increase (Fig. 9A). Thus, serial passaging of rEGFP clone 5 was continued until P15, and the same analysis was performed. Although smaller bands were observed, rEGFP clone 5 retained the full-length EGFP gene at least until P6 and had more or less lost it by P9 (Fig. 9B), but EGFP expression was still observed in infected cells even at P9 to a certain extent (data not shown). Sequencing of the major bands of rEGFP clone 5 at P15 (and clone 6 at P6) indicated that part of the EGFP gene was deleted (Fig. 9D). Similar to RT-PCR results, immunoblotting of the N protein and EGFP of rEGFP clone 5 indicated that EGFP expression peaked at P5 and then gradually decreased until P11 (Fig. 9C). It should be noted that the EGFP expression level increased dramatically compared to that of the original P0 virus.To further investigate rEGFP clone 5 P5, it was plaque purified three times, and three clones were expanded (designated rEGFP c1 to c3). These variants formed plaque morphologies similar to those of wtBToV and rBToV (Fig. 10A). Comparing growth kinetics among rEGFP c1 to c3, wtBToV, and rBToV revealed that their peak titers reached 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106.5 to 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009107.2 TCID50/mL at 72 hpi, which is comparable to those of parental viruses, although the peak was reached 1 day later (Fig. 10B). Immunoblotting of the N protein and EGFP indicated that the expression of both in cells infected with the rEGFP c1 to c3 were dramatically enhanced at 24 hpi compared to in the original P0 virus (Fig. 10C). As shown in Fig. 10E, these variants tended to stably express EGFP until P4, but smaller bands were mainly observed due to deletion of the full-length HE gene, with EGFP expression decreasing until P6 (data not shown for rEGFP c3). Sequencing the major band of rEGFP c1 to c3 P7 revealed a deletion of the EGFP gene, similar to those observed in other rEGFPs (Fig. 9D). Analysis of the full-length genome sequence of rEGFP c1 revealed five amino acid substitutions: G1001S, C1442F, and T2129I in NSP1, I3562T in NSP4, and I5327V in NSP10 (Fig. 10D). By sequencing the five corresponding regions of rEGFP c2 and c3, it was found that all variants shared two common mutations, C1442F and I3562T. Moreover, other rEGFPs (clones 1 to 4 and 6), which lack the HE gene by P5, did not have these two mutations. These data suggested that the two mutations in NSPs may contribute to acceptance of the exogenous EGFP gene, resulting in improved EGFP expression and viral growth, even though the EGFP gene was eventually lost.FIG 10FIG 10 Improvement of growth kinetics and EGFP expression of rEGFP. (A) Representative plaque morphology of variant rEGFP. The rEGFP clone 5 P5 was plaque-purified three times, and three clones were expanded (designated c1 to c3). (B and C) Growth kinetics and immunoblotting of rEGFP (c1 to c3). Virus titers in HRT18A were determined (n\u2009=\u20094), and immunoblotting was performed as described for Fig. 8. The dashed line shows the detection limit. N.D, not detected. The cells were infected at an MOI of 0.05 and lysed at 24 hpi for rEGFP c1 to c3, rBToV, and wtBToV and at 36 hpi for rEGFP clone 5 at P0. (D) Full-length genome sequence of rEGFP c1. Mutations different from the pBAC-BToV-EGFP are shown. Two mutations common to rEGFP c1 to c3 are underlined (E) Genetic stability of the EGFP gene of rEGFP c1 and c2. The analysis of EGFP expression and EGFP gene retention of these viruses during serial passages is described in the legend to Fig. 9.Contribution of C1442F and I3562T to EGFP expression, EGFP gene retention, and growth properties.To determine whether C1442F and I3562T contributed to improved EGFP expression and viral growth, rEGFPs with either C1442F or I3562T and rEGFP with both C1442F and I3562T were created. To compare them with original rEGFP generated without plaque purification, these rEGFPs were generated and expanded without plaque purification. rEGFP with C1442F/I3562T (clone 1 and clone 2) were obtained from each independent experiment. These viruses were serially passaged seven times (P7), and the analysis described above was performed. Representative results are shown in Fig. 11. Compared to the original rEGFP, rEGFP with C1442F exhibited higher EGFP expression and retained the EGFP gene through a small number of passages. In contrast, rEGFP with I3562T exhibited similar or somewhat stronger EGFP expression relative to the original rEGFP and retained the EGFP gene through a higher number of passages than the original rEGFP and rEGFP with C1442F. rEGFPs with C1442/I3562T exhibited EGFP expression comparable to or higher than that of rEGFP with C1442F and retained the EGFP gene through a higher number of passages than the original rEGFP and rEGFP with C1442F. Next, to compare with plaque-purified rEGFP c1 to c3, rEGFP with C1442F/I3562T was plaque purified three times, and the two clones (clone 3 and clone 4) derived from different plaques were expanded. Both clones exhibited increased EGFP expression and retained the EGFP gene through a high number of passages, similar to the rEGFP c1 and c2 variants (Fig. 11). Finally, the growth kinetics of these recombinant BToVs were compared (Fig. 12). The growth kinetics of the rEGFP with I3562T and rEGFPs with C1442F/I3562T were not significantly different from those of rEGFP variants c1 to c3. In contrast, rEGFP with C1442F exhibited delayed growth ability, with the titer at 48 hpi being more than 1 log lower than for the other viruses, reaching a peak at 72 hpi. All these data indicated that C1442F was associated with increased EGFP expression, whereas I3562T was mainly implicated in EGFP gene retention and greater virus growth. Taken together, the data indicate that both mutations contributed to EGFP expression, EGFP gene retention, and viral growth.FIG 11FIG 11 EGFP gene stability of rEGFP with C1442F, I3562T, or C1442F/I3562T. rEGFP with C1442F or I3562T and rEGFP with C1442F/I3562T (clone 1 and clone 2) were not plaque purified, while two clones of rEGFP with C1442F/I3562T (clone 3 and clone 4) were plaque purified.

To our knowledge, this is the first reverse genetics system for the new family Tobaniviridae. The Red/ET recombination method used to assemble eight BToV cDNA fragments into the BAC was recently utilized for full-length cDNA assembly of some CoVs, PEDVs, and FIPVs (86, 87) as well as for introducing mutations (89, 95, 96). This method is more rapid and produces mutated clones more efficiently than traditional methods (89). During construction of the BAC-based BToV plasmid, an unexpected obstacle was the unintentional insertion of an E. coli-derived sequence into BToV cDNA, which may counter toxic regions in bacteria (Fig. 1). Such E. coli-derived sequence insertions were not seen in the full-length genome assembly of PEDV and FIPV into low-copy-number BAC plasmids via the same method (86, 87) but were observed in the subcloning of a TGEV cDNA fragment into high-copy-number plasmids (84). The position where the E. coli sequence was inserted is similar in both (BToV at nucleotide 10136 and TGEV at nucleotide 9973), suggesting that these regions in ToVs and CoVs (a 3C-like protease in BToV) are particularly toxic in bacteria. For BToV, because the insertion of the E. coli-derived sequence was observed even in a low-copy-number BAC plasmid, this region may be more toxic than that of CoV. As the E. coli sequence in BToV cDNA could not be removed via the Red/ET method, it was removed using the type IIS restriction enzyme SapI and subsequent in vitro ligation (Fig. 2A). Thus, in order to establish other BAC-based ToV reverse genetics via the current method, it may be better to counter the toxic region (3-C like protease gene) beforehand with an E. coli-derived sequence flanked by type IIS restriction enzyme sites for subsequent in vitro ligation.Characterization of recombinant BToV with the full-length HE gene.As cell-adapted BToV generally lost the full-length HE gene, the HE protein is not essential for viral growth in cells or may even suppress growth (59\u201361). In this study, the recombinant BToVs (Aichi strain) exhibited no significant differences in virus growth in cells with or without the full-length HE gene. Similar results were observed for MHV, and recombinant MHVs (rMHVs) expressing or lacking HE proteins did not have significantly different effects on virus growth properties (55). However, the competition experiments with them showed that HE-lacking rMHV grew more efficiently than HE-expressing rMHV. Because no competition experiments were conducted in our study, the possibility that there are slight differences in growth properties between recombinant BToV with HEf and HEs could not be ruled out. Overall, these data support the idea that HE proteins are dispensable for virus growth in cells. On the other hand, serial passage experiments revealed differences between MHV and BToV. The experiment using rMHV carrying the full HE gene showed that the HE proteins were inactive in about half of the viruses by six passages, suggesting that MHV HE proteins are disadvantageous for viral replication in vitro (55). In contrast, our results indicated that some rBToVs lost the full HE gene during passages similarly to MHV, while others could retain it through up to 20 passages. This was unexpected because another BToV (Niigata strain), which was isolated from a clinical sample and purified by limited dilution in our laboratory, had completely lost the full-length HE gene by eight passages (Md Taimur Islam and Fumihiro Taguchi, unpublished data). This difference may be partially explained by cell adaptation; that is, the Aichi strain, which has been already passaged in cells several times, is more adapted to cells than the clinical Niigata strain.Comparison of growth kinetics indicated that all P20 viruses, with or without the full HE gene, grew faster than parental P0 viruses, suggestive of their greater adaptation to cells during passages. In addition, P20 viruses with the full HE gene harbored mutations in close proximity within the NSP1 gene, and their virus titers tended to be higher than those of P20 viruses without the full HE gene and parental P0 viruses. Based on these observation, two mechanisms of cell adaptation may be utilized by recombinant Aichi-BToV with the full HE gene. One is that recombinant viruses lost the HE gene in order to adapt to cells, similarly to MHV and ToVs reported so far. The other is the accumulation of mutations in NSPs, allowing adaptation while retaining the HE gene. In the latter case, the close mutation group of H1342Y, F1344V, and S1364R and the second close mutation group of L1445P and I1464V in NSP1 might be involved in HE gene retention. Of note, L1445P is located very close to C1442F, which is one of the mutations involved in exogenous EGFP gene acceptance. However, since these were not the only mutations in P20 viruses with the full HE gene, the involvement of other mutations in HE retention cannot be ruled out. Further analysis through reverse genetics should reveal the significance of these mutations for HE retention or cell adaptation.The requirement for HE protein in cultured cells differs between virus species. Unlike MHV and ToVs, the HE protein of HCoV-OC43 is essential for viral replication because the S proteins use O-Ac-Sias as a receptor, and the receptor-destroying activity of HE is indispensable for promoting the release of viral progeny from infected cells (50). In the case of HCoV-OC43, recombinant virus was rescued when the cells were transfected with infectious cDNA clones of HCoV-OC43 harboring the HE gene but not when they were transfected with those lacking an HE gene. However, recombinant virus lacking the HE gene was successfully rescued via HE protein complementation. Although BToV HE proteins were not essential based on the present findings, since the titers of P20 viruses with the full HE gene tended to be higher than those of P20 viruses without, it was suggested that the HE protein of Aichi-BToVs may confer some advantage to viral growth in cells. Thus, in order to determine whether the complementation of HE proteins had an effect on the production of infectious recombinant BToVs, experiments similar to those for HCoV-OC43 were performed (Fig. 7). Unlike for HCoV-OC43, we found no statistically significant differences of infectious recombinant BToV production via HE protein complementation assays. The precise function of the BToV HE protein in cultured cells remains to be further elucidated in future studies.Characterization of recombinant BToV with the EGFP gene.Since recombinant viruses expressing reporter proteins such as GFP, red fluorescent protein, and luciferase are useful for understanding fundamental viral processes as well as for the high-throughput screening of therapeutic compounds, recombinant CoVs carrying these reporters were previously generated (69, 85\u201387, 92). The recombinant CoVs had their ORF3, ORF4, or ORF5 accessory genes replaced with reporter genes and stably expressed reporter proteins while retaining comparable or slightly lower growth abilities relative to the parental virus. In the present study, rEGFP, in which the accessory HE gene was replaced with EGFP, successfully expressed the fluorescent protein. However, it exhibited significantly reduced growth compared to parental wtBToV as well as lower EGFP expression. Furthermore, rEGFP rapidly lost EGFP expression after a single passage due to deletion of the HE gene. As EGFP is a neutral protein and probably does not confer any advantage or disadvantage for viral growth in cells, it is the EGFP gene that may have a negative effect on viral growth. In fact, plaque-purified rEGFPs exhibited drastically enhanced growth properties after loss of the EGFP gene (data not shown). Various deletion patterns of the EGFP gene were observed in eight independent experiments. Interestingly, in five of the experiments, the starting points of HE deletion were concentrated around specific positions, namely, nucleotides 24, 27, 28, and 30. In four of the experiments, the end points concentrated at around nucleotides 668, 671, 673, and 690 (Fig. 9D). These suggested that specific nonfavorable positions or structures of the EGFP gene, potentially suppressing viral genome replication or transcription, are easily recognized and deleted.Interestingly, rEGFP variants obtained during serial passages showed remarkably improved EGFP expression and growth ability in cells. Sequencing analysis of these three plaque-purified rEGFP variants (c1 to c3) revealed that they shared C1442F and I3562T mutations in NSP1 and NSP4, respectively. Thus, rEGFPs with either C1442F, I3562T, or C1442F/I3562T were generated through reverse genetics, and their characterization indicated that each mutation has an independent role. That is, C1442F in NSP1 predominantly contributed to an increase in EGFP expression, while I3562T in NSP4 mainly contributed to retention of the EGFP gene and enhanced virus growth. It should be noted that the improvement in virus growth was not directly correlated with the increase in EGFP expression. In fact, rEGFP with C1442F exhibited lower growth kinetics but had higher EGFP expression than rEGFP with 3562T, suggesting that C1442F may promote transcription of the EGFP gene, resulting in increased expression of EGFP. Therefore, rEGFP harboring both mutations (C1442F/I3562T) exhibited drastically improved EGFP expression, EGFP gene retention, and viral growth.This is the first report to propose that mutations in NSP1 and NSP4 are associated with exogenous gene acceptance, as in the case of EGFP. However, the molecular mechanism underlying such exogeneous gene acceptance remains unknown, since the functions of ToV NSP1 and NSP4 are not well understood. NSP1 of ToVs is a large polypeptide which corresponds to NSP1 to -3 or NSP2 and -3 of the CoV genome and contains a macrodomain, papain-like protease, and the first transmembrane domain, which are conserved among ToVs and CoVs (34). However, C1442F or the close mutation group (e.g., L1445P) in NSP1 of P20 viruses retaining the HE gene were not contained in any of these domains. In contrast, the NSP4 of ToVs, which corresponds to NSP6 of CoVs, contains the third transmembrane domain, and I3562T is located within it. ToV and CoV infections induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) where replication/transcription complex (RTC) is assembled by most NSPs, and viral RNA synthesis occurs (97\u2013100). The DMVs of CoV were reported to be formed by NSP3 and NSP4 or NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 (corresponding to NSP1, NSP2, and NSP4 of ToVs) (101, 102). Thus, mutations in NSP1 and NSP4 of ToV may affect DMV formation or the RTC within DMVs, although it is not known which ToV NSPs are involved in DMV formation. Therefore, some changes in DMV and RTC may counter specific unfavorable positions or structures of the EGFP gene, promoting its transcription and replication, which subsequently improves viral growth. The finding that ToV tolerates unfavorable foreign genes to some degree without clear positive selection may contribute to understanding the mechanism through which it evolves by accepting other genes.In summary, we developed a reverse genetics platform for BAC-based BToV, which is a useful tool for the study fundamental viral processes, infection pathogenesis, and BToV vaccine development. The recombinant viruses generated herein and the reverse genetics system can contribute to an improved understanding of ToV as an underinvestigated and neglected pathogen.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and viruses.The human rectal adenocarcinoma sub-cell line HRT18-Aichi (59\u201361) and 293T and COS7 cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s modified minimum Eagle medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) [DMEM(+)] and penicillin (50 U/mL)-streptomycin (50\u2009\u03bcg/mL) (PS) (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell-adapted BToV (Aichi strain) was propagated in HRT18 cells in DMEM without FBS [DMEM(\u2212)], as FBS inhibits BToV infection.Antibodies.Anti-HE, anti-M, and anti-N polyclonal mouse (mouse anti-HE, anti-M, and anti-N) antiserum and anti-N polyclonal rabbit (rabbit anti-N) antiserum were obtained following the method previously described (41). Anti-HA tag mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5) (mouse anti-HA 12CA5) was obtained from the supernatants of the hybridoma cells. Anti-HA-tag polyclonal rabbit IgG (rabbit anti-HA) antibody (MBL Nagoya, Japan) and anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (mFx75) (mouse anti-GFP) (Fujifilm Wako, Osaka, Japan) were purchased. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, PA, USA), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA), and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM+IgA (Rockland Immunochemicals) and IgG+IgM (Jackson Immuno Research, PA, USA). Two Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and two FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were mixed 1:1, respectively, and used.RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequencing.Viral RNA was extracted from 100 to 250\u2009\u03bcL of the supernatant using TRIzol LS reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and oligo(dT)15 primer (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) or oligo(dT-3) site adaptor primer for 3\u2032 RACE (TaKaRa). To analyze the complete BToV genome, seven fragments of about 3,500 to 4,500 bp overlapping 170 to 360\u2009bp (which corresponded to the BToV-derived sequence of fragments BToV-A to -G described below) and one fragment of about 320\u2009bp of the 3\u2032-terminal region by 3\u2032 RACE were amplified using a Phusion high-fidelity PCR kit (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) under the following conditions: 98\u00b0C for 50 s; 35 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 60 to 65\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1\u2009min/kb; 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. These PCR fragments were purified with AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). 5\u2032 ends of the viral genome were analyzed with 5\u2032-Full RACE Core Set (TaKaRa), and the PCR products of 5\u2032 RACE were cloned using pGEM-T Easy vector systems (Promega, WI, USA). Purified PCR fragments and pGEM cloning 5\u2032-terminal sequences of BToV were sequenced using primers designed for every \u223c300\u2009bp of the BToV genome. Sequences were assembled by MEGA6 (103) or Sequencher software (Hitachi High-Tech, Tokyo, Japan). Even without 5\u2032 RACE, almost the entire full-length sequencing was achieved, except for 21\u2009bp at the 5\u2032 end derived from the primer, applied to the full-length sequencing of all recombinant viruses.BAC construction of wtBToV.pBeloBAC11 containing CMV immediate early promoter, Rz, and BGH termination (83) was used. Full-length cDNA of the BToV genome was assembled under the control of the CMV promoter and was flanked at the 3\u2032 end by a poly(A) tail (Fig. 1A), using a Red/ET recombination system counterselection BAC modification kit (Gene Bridges, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Fig. 1B). Briefly, E. coli strain NEB10\u03b2 (Bio-Rad) carrying the BAC was electroporated with the pRed/ET expression plasmid using an Eppendorf Eporator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The Red/ET recombinant enzyme was induced by l-arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich) and a temperature shift from 30\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C, and then a linear rpsL/Neo-counterselection/selection cassette (prepared by PCR) flanked by hms was electroporated so that the Red/ET recombination inserted the rpsL/Neo cassette into the target position through hms. Only E. coli carrying the BAC with the rpsL/Neo cassette could be selected by kanamycin at 30\u00b0C. The Red/ET enzyme was induced in the same way in E. coli carrying a modified BAC and was electroporated with the linear cDNA fragment of BToV flanked by hms. Red/ET recombination could replace the rpsL/Neo cassette with the cDNA fragment of BToV. Only E. coli carrying the BAC with the target BToV cDNA fragment could be selected by streptomycin at 37\u00b0C, at which the pRed/ET plasmid was removed (Fig. 1B).To use this system, the full-length genomic sequence of BToV was divided into eight fragments flanked by the hms and was assembled into the BAC plasmid in sequential order (Fig. 1A). To distinguish the base numbers between BToV and BAC, the BToV genome is 28,313\u2009nucleotides (nt) [without poly(A); positions are given without parentheses], while BAC is 8,219\u2009bp, and its numbers are in parentheses, with numbering starting from the CMV promoter. The BToV-derived sequences of each fragment correspond to nucleotides 1 to 4497 (BToV-A), 4139 to 8512 (BToV-B), 8301 to 12748 (BToV-C), 12413 to 16612 (BToV-D), 16444 to 20731 (BToV-E), 20512 to 24877 (BToV-F), 24675 to 28196 (BToV-G), and 27987 to 28313 (BToV-H). The 5\u2032-terminal hm of the BToV-A fragment and the other fragments were regions of a partial CMV promoter, (205) to (605), and regions overlapping between the fragments. The 3\u2032 terminal hm of all fragments is the region including Rz and BGH, which is (606) to (1,001) (Fig. 1A).Fragments BToV-A to -G were prepared using standard PCR protocols with the overlap extension technique (104). Fragment BToV-H was prepared through PCR using a plasmid template containing a chemically synthesized BToV sequence between nucleotides 27987 and 28313, 25\u2009nt of adenine (pA), and the hm of the 3\u2032-terminal sequence described above (Eurofins, Luxembourg, Luxembourg). All fragments were amplified using KOD Plus Neo (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and purified with gel-extraction and phenol-chloroform extraction before electroporation. After assembly of the eight fragments, BAC carrying the cDNA clone of the full-length BToV (pBAC-BToVmut1) contained three mutations, namely, two single mutations at G3399T (E871D in NSP1 protein) and at T8469G (silent), and the E. coli chromosomal-derived sequence of 1,350\u2009bp was inserted at nucleotide 10136 (Fig. 2A). The pRed/ET recombination method could revert two substitutions but failed to delete the E. coli chromosomal-derived sequence. To delete this sequence in vitro, the type IIS restriction enzyme SapI (New England Biolabs), which recognizes asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave outsides their 5\u2032-GCTCTTCN\u2193NNN -3\u2032 recognition site, was used. First, two SapI sites at positions (4526) and (5736) near or in the SopA gene of BAC plasmid were removed by introducing single mutations, 5\u2032-(4526) GCTCTTC\u2192CCTCTTC and 5\u2032-(5736) GCTCTTC\u2192GGTCTTC, using NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly master mix (New England Biolabs) and two NgoMVI restriction sites located outside the two SapI sites at (3633) and (7549). Next, SapI recognition sites were inserted on both sides (one in the reverse direction) of the E. coli chromosome-derived sequence by pRed/ET recombination. Finally, the resulting BAC plasmid (pBAC-BToVmut2) was treated with SapI and was subjected to in vitro self-ligation (pBAC-BToVpre). pBAC-BToVpre was electroporated into NEB10\u03b2 and was successfully propagated.BAC construction of mutant BToVs.To introduce mutations into the HE gene of pBAC-BToVpre, the rpsL/Neo cassette was inserted through the 5\u2032 terminal hm including a partial M gene, at nucleotides 26037 to 26249, and the 3\u2032 terminal hm including the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), poly(A), Rz, and BGH, at positions 28150 to (644), using pRed/ET recombination (Fig. 2B). The resulting BAC with the rpsL/Neo cassette (pBAC-BToVHE/N-rpsL/Neo) allows manipulation of the HE gene and the N gene. The rpsL/Neo cassette was replaced with the mutated HE gene or the EGFP gene (Fig. 2B).Cell-adapted wtBToV in our laboratory lost full-length HE (HEf) because of a stop codon at nt 481 (the base number of the HE gene), CAG (Q)\u2192TAG (stop), resulting in the soluble form HE 160 aa in length (HEs) (58, 60) (Fig. 3A). Using pBAC-BToVHE/N-rpsL/Neo, four pBAC plasmids were created: pBAC-BToV, with two genetic markers at T207C (T26530C) and T228A (T26554A); pBAC-BToV-HEf, with the replacement of a stop codon (TAG) with CAG to express full-length HE; and pBAC-BToV-HEs/HA and pBAC-BToV-HEf/HA, with the addition of an HA tag at the C terminus of HEs and HEf proteins, respectively. pBAC-BToV-HEf/HA had the HE gene mutation at nucleotide 1029, GAATTC\u2192GAACTC (silent), to remove the EcoRI site. In addition, pBAC-BToV-EGFP, in which the HE gene was replaced entirely with EGFP, was created. All BAC plasmids were purified with NucleoBond Xtra Maxi (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) from 1,000\u2009mL cultured E. coli cells.Rescue of recombinant BToVs.293T and HRT18 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 and 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well, respectively, on the day before the experiment. 293T cells were transfected with 1.0\u2009\u03bcg pBAC-BToV or -HE mutant and -EGFP with 1.5\u2009\u03bcL Lipofectamine 3000 and 2.0\u2009\u03bcL P3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at 37\u00b0C. The next day, DMEM(+) was replaced with 500\u2009\u03bcL DMEM(\u2212) to remove FBS. After 3 dpt, the supernatants were harvested. A 50-\u03bcL portion of supernatant was inoculated into susceptible HRT18 cells that had been washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, after which 450\u2009\u03bcL DMEM(\u2212) was added. After 2\u2009dpi, supernatants were harvested, and viruses were plaque purified three times. A 20-\u03bcL aliquot from the 100\u2009\u03bcL plaque suspension was added to HRT18 cells with 480\u2009\u03bcL DMEM(\u2212) in 24-well plates, and the supernatant was harvested after 2\u2009dpi. This was stored at \u221270\u00b0C as a master virus. Next, 100\u2009\u03bcL of the master viruses was expanded on HRT18 cells with 10\u2009mL DMEM(\u2212) in a 10-cm dish, and these viruses were harvested after the appropriate CPE was observed. These were stored as passage 0 (P0) viruses, which were used for subsequent experiments. In rEGFP, plaque purification of some recombinant viruses was omitted because of EGFP gene instability. 293T cells prepared on a 3-cm dish were transfected with 5\u00d7 reagent volumes and plasmid. A 2.5-mL portion of supernatant from transfected HRT18 cells was inoculated into the cells in a 10-cm dish to expand the viruses, and these viruses were then harvested. In this case, these were used as passage 0 (P0) viruses. In rEGFP experiments, purified viruses designated clone 1 and clone 2 were derived from different plaques, while viruses designated clone 3 to clone 6 were obtained from independent experiments without plaque purification. The nomenclature of recombinant BToV rescued from these BAC plasmids was rBToV(rHEs), rHEf, rHEs/HA, rHEf/HA, and rEGFP, respectively (Fig. 3A).Plaque assay.HRT18 cells were seeded onto six-well plates with 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/well. The next day, the cells were inoculated with 400\u2009\u03bcL of the diluted virus to form 10 to 20 plaques per well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. Unabsorbed viruses were removed, and the cells were overlaid with MEM (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.65% agarose (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 2\u2009nM l-glutamine (Sanko Junyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan), 10\u2009mM HEPES (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), and PS. These were incubated at 37\u00b0C until appropriately-sized plaques were observed (approximately 3 days). The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde (Fujifilm Wako) and stained with crystal violet. For plaque purification of viruses, without cell fixation, a well-isolated plaque was picked, resuspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL DMEM(\u2212), and stored at \u221270\u00b0C.Immunofluorescence staining.A 35-mm glass base dish (12-mm glass area) (Iwaki, Shizuoka, Japan) was seeded with 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 HRT18 cells the day before the experiment. Cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with 300\u2009\u03bcL recombinant BToV in DMEM(\u2212) with an MOI of 0.05. After 24 hpi (and 36 hpi only for the rEGFP), infected cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20\u2009min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-HE, anti-M antiserum, or rabbit and mouse anti-HA antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and were then incubated with a mixed FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or mixed Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse for mouse antiserum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies for rabbit antibody, for 2 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 solution (Dojindo) for 20\u2009min at room temperature. PBS washing was done twice between steps. Stained cells were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using an LSM 710 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).\u03b1-Naphthyl acetate esterase activity.HRT18 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with recombinant BToVs at an MOI of 0.05. At 24 hpi, cells were fixed with a fixative solution, stained for an \u03b1-NA esterase with an \u03b1-NA esterase staining kit (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and observed by phase-contrast microscopy.Immunoblotting.HRT18 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with the recombinant BToVs at an MOI of 0.05. COS7 cells were transfected with 1.0\u2009\u03bcg pCAGGS-HEf or pCAGGS-HEs with 1.5\u2009\u03bcL Lipofectamine 3000 and 2.0\u2009\u03bcL P3000 reagent. At 24 hpi (and 36 hpi only for rEGFP), infected HRT18 cells and 40-hpt-transfected COS7 cells were lysed with 100\u2009\u03bcL sample buffer (50\u2009mM Tris, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and were boiled for 5\u2009min. N protein, EGFP, and HA-tagged proteins of samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Merck Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-N antiserum or mouse anti-GFP antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, respectively. To detect HA-tagged proteins, mouse-anti-HA 12CA5 antibody to HA-tagged HEf and rabbit anti-HA antibody to HA-tagged HEs were used because of differences in their reactivities. Protein bands were visualized with ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare, IL, USA) on a Light Capture II instrument (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).Growth kinetics of recombinant BToVs.HRT18 cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with PBS and were infected with recombinant BToVs at an MOI of 0.001. After 1.5 h adsorption at 37\u00b0C, unadsorbed viruses were removed, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 0.5\u2009mL DMEM(\u2212) was added. Viruses in the supernatant were collected at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hpi and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Virus titers in the culture media were determined in a 96-well plate as TCID50, as previously described (105). In growth experiments, HRT18 cells maintained in different lots of FBS appeared to show different growth kinetics even in the same sample. Unfortunately, because we could not use the same lot of FBS throughout the experiment, HRT18 cells maintained in different lots of FBS are referred to as HRT18A and HRT18B in the growth experiment in the figure legends. Although viruses propagated on HRT18B tend to grow faster and at higher titers than viruses propagated on HRT18A, there is no difference in growth tendency among samples.Measurement of the stability of HE and EGFP gene.HRT18 cells in a 24-well plate were washed twice with PBS, after which 0.5\u2009mL DMEM(\u2212) was added; these were then infected with recombinant BToVs with an MOI of 0.001. After the appropriate CPE was observed (2 to 3\u2009dpi), the supernatant was harvested, and 0.5\u2009\u03bcL was inoculated into fresh cells, resulting in serial passages by a 1,000-fold diluted virus. To estimate stability of the HEf and EGFP genes during serial passages, HRT18 cells in a 24-well plate were infected with rHEf and rHEf/HA harvested at the indicated passage history with an MOI of 0.05, and cells at 24 hpi were subjected to an \u03b1-NA esterase assay or to immunoblotting of N proteins. EGFP expression of the infected cells with rEGFP was monitored during serial passages under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus CKX41 U-RFLT50; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Later, images of cells infected with rEGFP harvested at the indicated passage under the same conditions were taken, and EGFP and N proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Supernatants of the infected cells (resulting in +1 passage) were subjected to RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequencing as described above. PCR fragments of 1,130 and 1,630\u2009bp containing HE and EGFP genes, respectively, were amplified using TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa) under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 5\u2009min; 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1\u2009min/kb; and 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. DNase treatment was also performed before RNA extraction to digest BAC plasmid from transfection, depending on passage history.HE complementation assay.293T cells in a 24-well plate were cotransfected with 1.0\u2009\u03bcg pBAC-BToV or pBAC-BToV-HEf, along with 0.5\u2009\u03bcg pCAGGS, pCAGGS-HEs, pCAGGS-HEf, pCAGGS-HEs/HA, and pCAGGS-HEf/HA with 1.5\u2009\u03bcL Lipofectamine 3000 and 3.0\u2009\u03bcL P3000 reagent. After 3 dpt, the cells were subjected to immunoblotting of HA-tagged proteins, an assay for \u03b1-NA esterase activity, and immunofluorescence staining using mouse anti-N antiserum as described above. Virus titers in the supernatants were determined as TCID50.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Tsunemitsu Hiroshi (Nishimikawa Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Japan) for providing cell-adapted BToV (Aichi strain) and Yuasa Noriyuki (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Japan) for providing mouse anti-M antiserum.

{"text": "Establishment of a Reverse Genetic System from a Bovine Derived Influenza D Virus Isolate. \n Abstract: \nThe ruminant-associated influenza D virus (IDV) has a broad host tropism and was shown to have zoonotic potential. To identify and characterize molecular viral determinants influencing the host spectrum of IDV, a reverse genetic system is required. For this, we first performed 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) of all seven genomic segments, followed by assessment of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR activity prior to constructing the viral genomic segments of a contemporary Swiss bovine IDV isolate (D/CN286) into the bidirectional pHW2000 vector. The bidirectional plasmids were transfected in HRT-18G cells followed by viral rescue on the same cell type. Analysis of the segment specific 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding regions (NCR) highlighted that the terminal 3\u2032 end of all segments harbours an uracil instead of a cytosine nucleotide, similar to other influenza viruses. Subsequent analysis on the functionality of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR in a minireplicon assay revealed that these sequences were functional and that the variable sequence length of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR influences reporter gene expression. Thereafter, we evaluated the replication efficiency of the reverse genetic clone on conventional cell lines of human, swine and bovine origin, as well as by using an in vitro model recapitulating the natural replication site of IDV in bovine and swine. This revealed that the reverse genetic clone D/CN286 replicates efficiently in all cell culture models. Combined, these results demonstrate the successful establishment of a reverse genetic system from a contemporary bovine IDV isolate that can be used for future identification and characterization of viral determinants influencing the broad host tropism of IDV.\n\n\nKeywords: influenza D virus; IDV; reverse genetics; minireplicon assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. IntroductionThe Deltainfluenzavirus genus is the newest member of the Orthomyxoviridae virus family, and harbours the influenza D virus (IDV) species [1,2]. In 2011, IDV was first identified in a 15-week-old pig suffering from flu-like symptoms such as sneezing and dry cough [3]. Although IDV was initially discovered in swine, subsequent prevalence studies proposed that cattle are the primary host reservoir for IDV with a worldwide distribution [1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. In addition to cattle and swine, IDV was shown to infect a broad range of other animals, such as feral swine, water buffalo, sheep, horses and camelids [3,8,12,13,14,15,16]. Furthermore, the high seroprevalence among humans with frequent exposure to cattle, as well as the recent demonstration of productive IDV replication in human airway epithelial cells, indicate that the bovine-lineage of IDV has zoonotic potential [17,18].Reverse genetic systems are an important tool to identify and characterize viral determinants that can influence the viral host tropism [19,20,21,22,23]. The polarity of the segmented viral genome of Orthomyxoviruses requires that the 6\u20138 viral genomic segments are individually transcribed in a negative orientation to generate a template for the subsequent production of viral proteins and new progeny virus [24,25]. The first plasmid-based reverse genetic systems for Orthomyxoviruses were described in the late 1990s and early 2000s for influenza A virus [26,27,28]. The first system consisted of individual plasmids transcribing the negative sense RNA of each viral genomic segment in a RNA polymerase I dependent manner [26]. These plasmids were co-transfected with eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding for the nucleocapsid and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex proteins to initiate the production of replication competent viruses [26]. This system was later modified by the more efficient bidirectional vector system that incorporates both RNA polymerase I and II dependent transcription of each viral genomic segment and protein, respectively, within the same backbone [27,29]. This bidirectional plasmid-based reverse genetic system has also been described for influenza B and C viruses [30,31], and more recently also for the swine lineage (D/OK) of IDV [32]. Interestingly, despite cattle being the proposed main reservoir for IDV, no reverse genetic system has so far been established for the more prevalent bovine-lineage [5,33,34].The aim of this study is to establish a reverse genetic system for a bovine isolate of IDV, which would allow for the molecular characterization of viral determinants influencing the broad host tropism of IDV. For this, we first defined the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal sequences of the non-coding region (NCR) of the genomic segments from a previously identified Swiss bovine IDV isolate (D/bovine/Switzerland/CN286). This revealed that the first 12 and 11 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal NCR regions, respectively, are conserved among all the viral genome segments. However, the sequence length of the NCR genomic segments influences the amplitude of the reporter gene expression in a minireplicon assay. Rescue and subsequent viral replication kinetic experiments with the reverse genetic clone of D/CN286 on conventional human, bovine and swine cell lines, as well as well-differentiated airway epithelial cell (AEC) cultures from bovine and porcine origin, revealed robust viral replication. These combined results demonstrate that we have established a reverse genetic system for IDV from a bovine isolate that allows us to perform detailed characterization of viral determinants influencing the host tropism of IDV. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell CultureThe Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cell line was maintained in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM; (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)) supplemented with 7% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 2 mmol/L Glutamax (Gibco), 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin and 100 IU/mL penicillin (Gibco). Human rectal tumour 18G (HRT-18G, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA ), Swine Testicular (ST, ATCC) cells and human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293-LTV (LTV-100; Cellbiolabs, San Diego, CA, USA) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum essential medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS (HRT-18G) or 10% FBS (ST and 293T-LTV), 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin and 100 IU/mL penicillin (Gibco). Well-differentiated airway epithelial cell (AEC) cultures of bovine and swine origin were established from post-mortem tracheobronchial epithelial tissue and maintained according to the protocol by Gultom et al. [35]. All cell cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. 2.2. Determination of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)The nucleotide sequences of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs of the D/bovine/Switzerland/CN286 (D/CN286) virus isolate were determined by an in-house protocol, based on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RACE kit (2nd generation, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Viral nucleic acids were extracted from 140 \u03bcL of the virus transport medium derived from the nasopharyngeal swab using the viral RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). For the 3\u2032 RACE, isolated viral RNA was poly-adenylated using E. coli poly-A polymerase (New England Biolabs, NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by a reverse transcriptase (RT)-step with Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus RT (MMLV-RT, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (RNAsin plus, 10U, Promega) by incubation for 1 h at 42 \u00b0C and 20 min of 65 \u00b0C using the tagRACE_dT16 oligonucleotide (Table S1). For 5\u2032 RACE, instead of the tagRACE_dT16 oligonucleotide, a segment-specific reverse oligonucleotide was used as described above, followed by nucleic acid purification and poly-adenylation of the cDNA with terminal transferase (NEB) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C followed by 10 min heat-inactivation at 70 \u00b0C. For both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 RACE, an initial touchdown PCR was performed with Hotstart Taq master mix (Qiagen) with segment-specific primers and tagRACE_dT16 reverse oligonucleotides (Table S1), using the following cycle profile; 95 \u00b0C for 15 min; 15 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 65 \u00b0C touchdown to 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; 25 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. After the first amplification round, the segment-specific PCR products were 100-fold diluted in nuclease free water and used as template in a nested PCR using segment-specific oligonucleotides, in combination with the tagRACE adapter oligonucleotide, using the touchdown PCR protocol (Table S1). Thereafter, PCR products were purified using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) from which the nucleotide sequence was determined using Sanger sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). Sequence analysis was performed in Geneious Prime (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand, v2020.2.4). The PB2 (5\u2032), HEF (5\u2032), and NS1 (3\u2032) sequences were determined from purified product cloned into the pGEM-T vector by TA-cloning (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2018s guidelines. 2.3. Plasmid Construction 2.3.1. Minireplicon Reporter ConstructsFor the generation of minireplicon reporter constructs for each of the seven genomic segments of IDV, the coding sequence of the Gaussia luciferase reporter was amplified from the pMCS-Gaussia (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany) plasmid using a specific primer set (Table S1), and CloneAmp HiFi PCR (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to manufacturer\u2018s guidelines, using the following cycle profile; 98 \u00b0C 10 s, 55 \u00b0C 10 s, 72 \u00b0C 10 s for 35 cycles. Followed by subcloning the PCR amplicon in BamHI (NEB) restriction digested pCW57-tGFP-2A-MCS plasmid, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Adam Karpf (Addgene plasmid #71783, [36]), using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara). From the resulting pCW57-GFP-2A-Gaussia plasmid, the tGFP-2A-Gaussia luciferase coding sequence was amplified using oligonucleotides harbouring segment-specific NCR nucleotide sequence overhangs from the IDV D/660 isolate (Table S1). The resulting seven different amplicons were individually subcloned into the pHH21 vector, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Georg Kochs, University of Freiburg, Germany, using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara). As a transfection control for the minireplicon assay, the tRFP-2A coding sequence was amplified from the pCW57-tRFP-2A-MCS plasmid, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Adam Karpf (Addgene plasmid #78933, [36]) (Table S1), using CloneAmp HiFi PCR (Takara) and was subcloned in the Thymidine kinase Cypridina plasmid (ThermoFisher) in-frame with the Cypridina luciferase gene, using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara), resulting in the pTK-RFP-2A-Cypridina luciferase plasmid. The polymerase complex subunits PB2, PB1, P3 and NP from D/660 and D/CN286 were amplified from the respective bidirectional pHW2000 plasmid constructs using CloneAmp Hifi PCR mix (Takara) with the following cycle profile; 98 \u00b0C 10 s, 55 \u00b0C 10 s, 72 \u00b0C 20 s for 35 cycles followed by subcloning into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara). All plasmids were isolated using the Nucleobond Xtra midi kit (Macherey-Nagel), and verified by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). 2.3.2. Construction of Reverse Genetic CloneTwo microliters of extracted viral RNA were used as template to amplify the seven genomic segments individually with segment-specific oligonucleotides using the Superscript IV one-step RT-PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to manufacturer guidelines. The bidirectional pHW2000-vector, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Martin Schwemmle, University of Freiburg, Germany, was amplified using CloneAmp HiFi PCR mix (Takara) in a 2-step PCR-program of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s followed by 68 \u00b0C for 4 min, with 35 cycles. Both PCR products were excised from a 1% agarose gel and extracted using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and used as templates for In-Fusion HD cloning (Takara). Positive constructs were identified by colony PCR using the segment-specific PCR primers and GoTaq green master mix (Promega) with the following cycle profile; 94 \u00b0C 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 \u00b0C, 1 min, 55 \u00b0C 1 min, 72 \u00b0C 2 min, and a final elongation step of 7 min at 72 \u00b0C. All plasmids were isolated using the Nucleobond Xtra midi kit (Macherey-Nagel) and verified by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth). 2.4. Minireplicon AssayOne day prior to the minireplicon assay, 293-LTV cells were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells per well, in black-wall, clear bottom 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) in DMEM medium containing 15 mM HEPES (Gibco). For each minireplicon reaction, 50 ng of reporter plasmid containing one of the IDV segment specific NCR was mixed with 100 ng of each polymerase subunit (PB2, PB1 and P3) and 200 ng of NP in the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS in 50 \u03bcL of Optimem (Gibco), together with 250 ng of pTK-RFP-2A-Cypridina luciferase as transfection control. An equal amount of Optimem containing PEImax (1 mg/mL, Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) in a 1:3 DNA:transfection reagent ratio was prepared and added to the overexpression plasmids. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, 20 \u03bcL volumes from the transfection mixture were divided into three technical replicates. The polymerase activity based on secreted luciferase activity was monitored, by collecting 50 \u03bcL of supernatant and replenishment with fresh medium every 24 h. Supernatant samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for subsequent analysis. In parallel, the polymerase activity was monitored by the detection of fluorescence reporter expression on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Sursee, Switzerland) equipped with a 4x air objective (numerical aperture (NA): 0.13). Four images were acquired per well to cover the entire surface of the well and processed and stitched using the Gen5 Image prime software package (v3.08.01). The number of cells that express turbo green fluorescent protein (tGFP, polymerase activity) or turbo red fluorescent protein (tRFP, transfection control) were determined for each individual well using the Gen5 ImagePrime software package (v3.08.01). Gaussia and Cypridina luciferase activities were measured separately in the collected supernatant samples using the Pierce Gaussia or Cypridina luciferase flash assay kits (Thermo Fischer Scientific), respectively, on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek). Ten \u03bcL of supernatant per reaction were loaded into white, half area 96-well plates (Costar), followed by the injection of 15 \u03bcL of substrate and direct measurement of the luminescent signal. 2.5. Rescue of IDV from Reverse Genetic PlasmidsOne day prior to virus rescue, 1 million HRT-18G cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates (Techno Plastic Products AG (TPP), Trasadingen, Switzerland). For every viral rescue, each viral segment in the bidirectional pHW2000 plasmid was diluted to a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg per reaction, followed by transfection using PEImax (1 mg/mL) in a 1:3 DNA:transfection reagent ratio. After 48 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, the supernatant was removed, and cells were washed twice with MEM medium. After the final washing, cells were supplemented with infection medium, consisting of MEM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 15 mM of HEPES (Gibco), 100 \u03bcg/mL of penicillin and 100 IU of streptomycin (Gibco), and 0.25 \u03bcg/mL of bovine-pancreas isolated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Followed by an additional incubation for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C. Hereafter, the supernatant was collected and diluted 10-fold and inoculated onto a confluent layer of HRT-18G cells in a 6-well cluster plate and incubated for a total duration of 72 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The final virus stock was collected and titrated by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) method, as described previously [18]. Rescued viruses were sequence-verified with Sanger sequencing through the amplification of individual genomic segments, as described above. 2.6. Nucleotide Homology AnalysisNucleotide sequences of each segment of the prototypic D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660, accession numbers: KF425659-65) were analysed for their homology to the D/CN286 consensus sequences determined by MinION Nanopore sequencing (Glaus et al., unpublished data) in Geneious prime (v2020.2.4). 2.7. Viral Replication KineticsOne day prior to infection, the conventional cell lines HRT-18G and ST were seeded at a density of 250.000 cells per well in a 12-well format (TPP), while 125.000 cells were used for the MDBK cell line. Viral infection was performed as previously described, using an MOI of 0.01 for the HRT-18G and ST cell lines, while the MDBK cell line was infected with an MOI of 0.1 [18]. The well-differentiated AEC cultures of porcine and bovine origin were inoculated with 10.000 TCID50 per insert. For the conventional cell lines, the viral replication kinetics were monitored for 72 h in 24-h intervals, at which 250 \u03bcL of supernatant was collected and replenished with fresh medium. While progeny virus production was monitored for 96 h for the well-differentiated porcine and bovine AEC cultures, the apical wash was collected every 24 has described before [18]. After the last time point, cells were fixed with 4% (V/V) neutral buffered formalin for later immunostaining (Formafix AG, Hittnau, Switzerland). 2.8. ImmunostainingFormalin-fixed conventional cell cultures and well-differentiated AEC cultures were immunostained according to a previously described protocol [35]. For the detection of IDV-positive cells, cell cultures were stained with a custom-generated rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the NP of the prototypic D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 strain (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) [18]. Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488-labeled donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch, Westgrove, PA, USA) was applied as secondary antibody. For the porcine and bovine AEC cultures cilia and tight junctions were visualized using an Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647-conjugated rabbit anti-\u03b2-tubulin (9F3, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594-conjugated mouse anti-Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) (1A12, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples were counterstained using 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to visualize nuclei. Images for the HRT-18G, ST, and MDBK cell lines were acquired on the EVOS FL auto 2 fluorescence microscopes (Thermo Fischer Scientific), using a 10\u00d7 air (NA: 0.3) objective. For the AEC cultures, inserts were mounted on Colorforst Plus microscopy slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Prolong diamond antifade mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and overlaid with 0.17 mm high precision coverslips (Marienfeld, Lauda-K\u00f6nigshofen, Germany). Z-stack images were acquired on a DeltaVision Elite High-Resolution imaging system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) using a step size of 0.2 \u03bcm with a 60\u00d7/1.42 oil objective. Acquired images were cropped and deconvolved using the integrated softWoRx software package and processed using Imaris (Version 9.4.3, Bitplane AG, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) and FIJI [37]. 2.9. Data RepresentationAll graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism software (Prism, San Diego, CA, USA, v9.0.0) and final figures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator CS6 (v16.0.0). Brightness and contrast of microscope pictures were minimally adjusted and processed identically to their corresponding control using FIJI (v1.53) [37]. 3. Results 3.1. Determination of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs of the Genomic Segments from a Bovine IDV IsolateIDV has been shown to infect a broad range of animal species including cattle, swine and small ruminants, with cattle as the proposed main host reservoir [1]. However, thus far no reverse genetic system has been established for a bovine isolate of IDV, that can be used to characterize viral determinants which influences the broad host tropism of IDV among even-toed ungulates. We previously determined the prevalence of IDV in a Swiss cattle cohort and analysed the phylogenetic relationship of 10 clinical isolates to that of other IDV isolates (Glaus et al., Manuscript in preparation). During this study we did not determine the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs of each genomic segment. However, because of the importance of the NCR in viral replication and the previous reported sequence discrepancy among different IDV isolates in public sequence repositories, we decided to determine the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR sequences of the genomic segments from one of our bovine IDV isolates [38]. Based on the Ct-value and available amount of nasopharyngeal material, this was chosen to be the D/bovine/Switzerland/CN286 isolate (Glaus et al., Manuscript in preparation).We first performed 3\u2032 RACE for each genomic segment and readily observed that all seven genomic segments have a terminal uracil nucleotide at the 3\u2032 end of the genome, similar as other influenza viruses and found that the first 11 nucleotides (UCGUAUUCGUC) of the 3\u2032 NCR are conserved among all genomic segments (Figure 1) [39,40,41,42]. This finding corroborates the previous results from Ishida and colleagues and independently highlighted that the terminal nucleotide of the 3\u2032 NCR of genomic segments from several isolates are incorrectly annotated in public sequence repositories, including the prototypic D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 isolate [38]. The results from the 5\u2032 RACE revealed that the first 12 nucleotides are uniform for all seven genomic segments (AGCAGUAGCAAG) and correspond with the public available sequence data for IDV (Figure 1). In line with this observation, the constant terminal universal motif in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR in our bovine IDV isolate is followed by a segment-specific variable sequence region that seems to be conserved among different IDV isolates (Figure 1). 3.2. Analysis of the Functionality of the Different NCRs by Polymerase Reconstitution AssayFollowing the sequence determination of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR for each of the seven genomic segments, we wanted to investigate whether the segment-specific NCRs of IDV are functional and whether the nucleotide sequence length influences the transcription and replication efficiency of viral genomic segments. Traditionally, these assays are performed with a plasmid-driven polymerase reconstitution assay (minireplicon). This assay is based on the transfection of eukaryotic expression constructs encoding for the PB2, PB1 and PA/P3 polymerase subunits and the nucleoprotein (NP) in-trans with a plasmid that transcribes a negative strand RNA harbouring a reporter gene (e.g., firefly luciferase) that is flanked by the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NCR regions of a viral genomic segment [43,44]. This type of assay is often limited to one timepoint due to the readout method requiring lysis of the transfected cells. To overcome this, we established a reporter construct for IDV that harbours a tGFP-2A-Gaussia luciferase reporter, which allowed us to monitor and measure the influence of the NCR sequence length on gene expression at multiple time points simultaneously via fluorescent- and luciferase-based quantification assays (Figure 2A). To control for the transfection efficiency, we established a control plasmid that constitutively expresses a tRFP-2A-Cypridina luciferase and can be used in parallel for the normalization of the expression of both the tGFP and Gaussia luciferase reporter genes (Figure 2A).To demonstrate the functionality of this minireplicon assay, we first monitored the activity of the viral RNP complex of the prototypic D/660 isolates, as this virus replicates in cell cultures. This revealed that the tRFP fluorescent signal could be readily observed 24 h post-transfection, and that a large number of tGFP positive cells were detected in those cells containing the reporter construct with the NCR of the NP viral genomic segment after 72 h (Figure 2B). Here we observed that the highest reporter activity is detected for the NCR of the NP viral genomic segment followed by those for PB1, PB2, P3 and P42 (Figure 2C) with equal transfection efficiencies (Figure 2D). In contrast, the reporter activity for NS remained relatively low and the fluorescent signal of the HEF NCR was undetectable, similar to the control cells that lacked a reporter plasmid (Figure 2C). These results were corroborated when we analysed the activity of the D/CN286 RNP complex. Despite the fact that several amino acids differ between the D/CN286 and D/660 RNP complex subunits, a relatively similar activity was demonstrated, albeit with a moderately higher activity for the latter (Figure 2E,F, Table S2). The results obtained with the fluorescent-based assay were corroborated by the luciferase-based assay (Figure 2G,H). Interestingly, this revealed that the reporter activity of NS is approximately 10-100-fold lower compared to that of NP, PB1, PB2, PA, and P42, while for HEF this is even lower (Figure 2G,H). Because we previously observed that temperature potentially influences the replication kinetics of IDV [18], we also assessed the RNP complex activity with the different NCR reporter constructs at 33 \u00b0C. We observed that the transfection efficiencies and the number of tGFP positive cells for both the D/660 and D/CN286 RNPs are identical at 33 \u00b0C in comparison to 37 \u00b0C (Figure S1). However, based on the luciferase activity, we observed that the reporter activity as well as fluorescence intensity were lower at 33 \u00b0C in comparison to 37 \u00b0C. This minireplicon assay readout is likely influenced by the temperature dependence of protein folding kinetics (Figure S1) [45]. Nonetheless, these combined results clearly demonstrate that the NCR of the different constructs are functional, and that the nucleotide sequence length influences the transcription efficiency of the viral genomic segments. 3.3. Establishing a Reverse Genetic System for IDVAfter establishing the functionality of the NCR regions, the individual viral genomic segments from both the bovine D/660 and D/CN286 isolates were cloned into the bidirectional pHW2000-vector for the rescue of a reverse genetic clone of a bovine IDV isolate (Figure 3A,B) [27]. Sequencing of the obtained pHW2000 plasmids revealed that there were three amino acids different between the D/CN286 genetic clone and the consensus sequence from the clinical isolate, namely in the PB1 (D388N), P3 (R350K) and HEF (Q48P). The plasmids from the D/660 genetic clone were identical to the previous published sequences, except for the terminal Uracil nucleotides in the 3\u2032 NCR.Following cloning, we transfected the reverse genetic plasmids for rescue of our D/660 and D/CN286 clones into HRT-18G cells, as these cells support the propagation of IDV. After 72 h of incubation, the supernatant from the transfected cell cultures was collected and passaged upon fresh cultures of HRT-18G followed by viral titration. During the transfection and subsequent passage, we observed no cytopathogenic effect, which was also observed for the cell culture isolate of D/660. However, during the viral titration, that was based on the readout of the agglutination of chicken red blood cells, we measured rescued virus with a viral titre of approximately 107 Tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL for the D/CN286 rescued virus, while surprisingly no virus was detected for the D/660 reverse genetic clone (Figure 3C). Whole genome sequencing of the passage 1 of the rescued D/CN286 clone revealed that the sequence was identical to that of the reverse genetic plasmids, whereas for D/660 this could not be established.In the absence of a reverse genetic clone for D/660 and the retrospective identification of another respiratory virus, namely bovine coronavirus, in the CN286 clinical sample, we could not compare the replication kinetics of our rescued D/CN286 reverse genetic clone to the parental strain. Therefore, we instead compared the replication kinetics of the D/CN286 reverse genetic virus with that of the prototypic D/660 cell culture isolate on different cell culture models. We first monitored the viral kinetics on swine (ST), bovine (MDBK) and human (HRT-18G) cell lines for a total duration of 72 h. This revealed that the replication kinetics of the reverse genetic D/CN286 clone on HRT-18G and ST cell lines is comparable to the cell culture isolate of D/660 (Figure 4A,B). In contrast, the replication kinetics of D/CN286 on the bovine MDBK cell line was approximately 10-fold less efficient compared to the cell culture-adapted D/660 isolate (Figure 4C). In addition to the replication kinetics, we performed immunostaining using a polyclonal NP-directed antibody [18]. This demonstrated that a comparable amount of virus-antigen positive cells could be detected despite the differences in the replication kinetics between both viruses (Figure 4D\u2013F).Because the reverse genetic D/CN286 isolate was shown to efficiently replicate in cell lines derived from different species, and we aim to characterize viral determinants that can influence the viral host tropism of IDV, we wondered whether this virus would also infect in vitro cultures that recapitulate the natural target site of IDV. To this end, we inoculated well-differentiated airway epithelial cell (AEC) cultures derived from bovine and porcine origin with 10.000 TCID50 and monitored the viral kinetics for 96 h. This revealed that D/CN286 replicated efficiently in both bovine and porcine AEC cultures, albeit slightly higher in the swine AEC cultures (Figure 5A,B). This was also observed when the swine and bovine AEC cultures were infected with the cell culture-adapted D/660 isolate (Figure 5A,B). Interestingly, this also revealed a similar trend that had been previously observed in the conventional cell lines, namely that the cell culture-adapted D/660 virus replicates more efficiently compared to the D/CN286 reverse genetic clone. However, this effect does not seem to correspond to any difference in cell tropism, as both viruses infected ciliated cells (Figure 5C,D). This observation suggests that potential discrepancies in the replication efficiency are likely associated with the genetic differences between both virus stocks (Figure 5C,D). Nonetheless, these combined results demonstrate that we successfully established a reverse genetic clone from a bovine-derived IDV isolate that efficiently replicates in different cell culture models. 4. DiscussionIn this study we demonstrate the establishment of a functional reverse genetic system for a contemporary bovine isolate of IDV. Using 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RACE, we demonstrate that the 11 and 12 terminal nucleotides on the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NCRs, respectively are conserved on all viral genomic segments. However, using a novel minireplicon assay, we observed that the sequence length of the conserved segment-specific variable regions influences the RNP driven reporter activity, irrespective of using the RNP complex of the bovine D/660 or D/CN286 virus isolates. Despite the overlapping functionality, viable virus could only be rescued from the pHW2000 reverse genetic clone of D/CN286, and not for the prototypic D/660 isolate. The assessment of the replication competency of D/CN286 in different cell culture models, including well-differentiated airway epithelial cultures from bovine and porcine origin, revealed robust virus replication in all models. In combination, these results demonstrate the successful establishment of a reverse genetic system from a contemporary bovine IDV isolate that can be used for future identification and characterization of viral determinants influencing the broad host tropism of IDV.Previously, two other groups have successfully developed and established a reverse genetic clone for the prototypic swine-derived isolate of IDV (D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011, D/OK) [38,46]. However, in line with our results, none of the reports describe the successful establishment of a reverse genetic (RG) clone for the prototypic bovine isolate D/660. Interestingly, Ishida and colleagues and our results independently demonstrate that the terminal nucleotide of the 3\u2032 NCR of the viral genomic RNA contains an uracil (Figure 1) [38], while for the prototypic D/660 isolate the majority of genomic segments are wrongly annotated. However, we demonstrate that the correction of this nucleotide alone does not facilitate the successful rescue of an RG clone of D/660. This indicates that mutations in the coding region of the viral genome are of influence, as we demonstrate that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR of the prototypic D/660 isolate are functional. Therefore, it would be of interest to rescue the D/CN286 virus isolate with individual viral genomic segments replaced with one from the D/660. This strategy might reveal which genomic segment negatively influences the rescue of the RG clone of D/660.In our study, we demonstrate for the first time for IDV that the length of the segment-specific variable 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR sequence has an influence on reporter protein expression. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR sequences of the NS and HEF show the lowest reporter gene expression compared to those of the other genomic segments. Interestingly, this phenomenon has also been observed for the phylogenetically related influenza C Virus, where the sequence length of the variable region in the 5\u2032 NCR of the NS and PB2 segment impairs reporter gene expression [47]. Although we did not perform any mutational analysis on the segment-specific variable 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR in our study, it has been shown previously that a single nucleotide difference can have a detrimental influence [46]. It should however be noted that these results cannot be generalized to the expression levels of viral proteins, as it is well documented for influenza A virus that both the NCR and gene coding sequence simultaneously can influence transcription efficiency [48,49]. Therefore, further analysis is needed to determine which genomic sequence elements are of importance for IDV transcription.Following viral rescue, we show that our reverse genetic clone of the bovine D/CN286 isolate replicates in different cell culture models, including well-differentiated airway epithelial cultures of bovine and porcine origin. These results demonstrate, that in addition to our in vitro surrogate model of the human in vivo respiratory epithelium, IDV virus\u2014host interactions can also be studied in analogous models of porcine and bovine origin. However, in comparison to the prototypic bovine D/660 isolate, our RG D/CN286 virus replicated less efficiently on the MDBK cell line and in swine and bovine AEC cultures. This difference might be due to the fact that our RG D/CN286 isolate has 64 amino acid differences compared to the prototypic D/660 isolate, of which 25 are present in the HEF protein (Table S2). It is therefore plausible that these differences contribute to the overall lower replication efficiency of our RG clone in the primary bovine and swine AEC cultures. In addition, we previously demonstrated that the cell culture adapted D/660 isolate is composed out of a pool of different genomic variants [18]. Furthermore, the D/660 virus has a greater genomic plasticity to adapt to different host and cellular environments compared to the RG D/CN286 isolate that represents a single genomic variant [50]. Therefore, it would be of interest to study the influence of the 64 amino acid differences in our reverse genetic system and novel minireplicon assay, as well as in well-differentiated airway epithelial cultures from human, bovine and porcine origin. These results might lead to the identification and characterization of viral determinants influencing the broad host tropism of IDV.In summary, here we show the establishment of a functional reverse genetic system for a contemporary bovine isolate of IDV that will facilitate further characterization of the biology of IDV.\n\n\n Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/3/502/s1.

{"text": "A ligation and restriction enzyme independent cloning technique: an alternative to conventional methods for cloning hard-to-clone gene segments in the influenza reverse genetics system. \nAbstract \nBackgroundReverse genetics is used in many laboratories around the world and enables the creation of tailor-made influenza viruses with a desired genotype or phenotype. However, the process is not flawless, and difficulties remain during cloning of influenza gene segments into reverse genetics vectors (pHW2000, pHH21, pCAGGS). Reverse genetics begins with making cDNA copies of influenza gene segments and cloning them into bi-directional (pHW2000) or uni-directional plasmids (pHH21, pCAGGS) followed by transfection of the recombinant plasmid(s) to HEK-293\u2009T or any other suitable cells which are permissive to transfection. However, the presence of internal restriction sites in the gene segments of many field isolates of avian influenza viruses makes the cloning process difficult, if employing conventional methods. Further, the genetic instability of influenza gene-containing plasmids in bacteria (especially Polymerase Basic 2 and Polymerase Basic 1 genes; PB2 and PB1) also leads to erroneous incorporation of bacterial genomic sequences into the influenza gene of interest.MethodsHerein, we report an easy and efficient ligation and restriction enzyme independent (LREI) cloning method for cloning influenza gene segments into pHW2000 vector. The method involves amplification of megaprimers followed by PCR amplification of megaprimers using a bait plasmid, DpnI digestion and transformation.ResultsHard-to-clone genes: PB2 of A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014 (H9N2) and PB1 of A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014 (H9N2), A/chicken/Jiangxi/02.05YGYXG023-P/2015 (H5N6) and A/Chicken/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4\u2013315/2014 (H9N2) were cloned into pHW2000 using our LREI method and recombinant viruses were subsequently rescued.ConclusionThe LREI cloning procedure represents an alternative strategy for cloning influenza gene segments which have internal restriction sites for the enzymes used in reverse genetics. Further, the problem of genetic instability in bacteria can be alleviated by growing recombinant bacterial cultures at a lower temperature. This technique can be applied to clone any influenza gene segment using universal primers, which would help in rapid generation of influenza viruses and facilitate influenza research and vaccine development.\nBackgroundReverse Genetics (RG) is the process of in vitro generation of live virus with synthetic or PCR amplified genes [1]. This technique enables the creation of mutant influenza viruses of any desired genotype or phenotype. The RG technique was first employed for the rabies virus in the year 1994 [2], and this was soon followed by the establishment of the in vitro generation of a range of DNA and RNA viruses (including segmented or non-segmented RNA viruses) [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. The RG technology has also revolutionized the influenza field, progressing influenza research by way of genetically engineered recombinant influenza viruses. Reverse genetics as a tool has helped in studying the influenza host range [16, 17], transmission patterns [18] viral genome replication, pathogenicity and virulence [19,20,21]. This technique has also been implemented to develop influenza vaccines [22, 23] or recombinant influenza viruses harbouring reporter genes for studying virus egress and dissemination [24].Despite the utility of RG systems, the cloning step remains a limiting factor for the de-novo generation of viruses. Gene cloning is a crucial step in RG technology and has gained popularity in terms of usage but the technique involves restriction digest [25] followed by ligation, which sometimes becomes difficult to perform. The primary reasons are presence of internal restriction enzyme sites (eg. for BsmBI, BsaI, AarI or BbsI) in the different gene segments of field isolates of influenza virus. Further, the degradation of dNTPs in the ligation buffer or inefficient ligase enzyme also result in failure during ligation. The RG plasmids harbouring large inserts (>\u20092000\u2009bp) of influenza virus gene segments have also been shown to be unstable after transformation into E. coli cells [26, 27], which may be due to their toxicity to the bacterial host [28, 29]. This leads to incorporation of bacterial sequences into the target insert. As such, an alternative strategy for cloning is sought after. Ideally it would bypass the restriction-ligation steps, increase the efficacy of recombinant plasmid formation and reduce the chances of genetic recombination in the insert. Taking these aims into consideration, we have developed a ligation and restriction enzyme independent (LREI) cloning procedure for cloning influenza gene segments into the standard reverse genetics pHW2000 plasmid [30]. LREI cloning increases the chances of recombinant plasmid formation which if followed by growing bacteria at lower temperatures alleviates the problem of genetic recombination. Our work would be particularly beneficial to researchers who utilise the pHW2000 plasmid in RG workflows with influenza virus genes.Materials and methodsPrimer designPrimers were designed in such a way that the 5\u2032 end of the forward primer contains 16 nucleotides complementary to the one end of pHW2000 multiple cloning site (MCS) followed by 12 conserved nucleotide bases of influenza untranslated region (UTR) and 2\u20136 segment specific nucleotides towards the 3\u2032 end. The reverse primer constitutes 13 bases complementary to the other end of the pHW2000 MCS followed by influenza UTR, which contains the conserved 13 bases followed by 5\u20136 segment specific bases at the 3\u2032 end. The primer sequences for cloning PB2 and PB1 are described in Table\u00a01. The accession numbers of the polymerase genes used in this study are described in Table\u00a02.\nTable 1 Primers used for amplification of PB2 and PB1 gene segments and subsequent cloning into pHW2000 vectorFull size tableTable 2 Accession number (retrieved from GISAID/NCBI) of Polymerase genes used in the present studyFull size tableAmplification of MegaprimerA target amplicon (known as a megaprimer) with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overhangs complementary to the cloning site in pHW2000 plasmid which can facilitate the annealing of the megaprimer with the template plasmid was generated by PCR. The PB1 megaprimer of A/Chicken/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4\u2013315/2014/H9N2 [Vietnam/2014], A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014/H9N2 [Bangladesh/2014], and A/chicken/Jiangxi/02.05YGYXG023-P/2015/H5N6 [Jiangxi/2015] viruses and PB2 megaprimer of Vietnam/2014 virus were amplified from the respective amplicons present in the pMKT or pMK-RQ cloning vector (GeneArt\u00ae -Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the primers mentioned in Table 1. The PB1 megaprimer was also amplified from the viral RNA of Vietnam/2014 virus. Briefly, the viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using Verso cDNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and universal 12 primers (Uni 12) [31]. The PB1 megaprimer was amplified using 20\u2009nM of forward and reverse primers (Table 1) and Pfu Ultra II hotstart PCR master mix (Agilent Technologies). The PCR amplification steps include: initial denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, followed by 35\u2009cycles of denaturation (95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s), annealing (58\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s) and extension (72\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009min) followed by final extension (72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min). The amplified virus gene-specific amplicons (Megaprimers) were purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and quantified using nanodrop (ThermoFisher Scientific).Cloning PCR, DpnI digestion and transformationPurified megaprimers (250\u2009ng) were subjected to thermocycling using Pfu Ultra II hotstart PCR master mix (Agilent Technologies) using pHW2000 containing Polymerase Acidic (PA) gene from A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014 (H9N2) [Bangladesh/2014] (100\u2009ng) (Fig.\u00a01). The thermocycling conditions include: initial denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009min followed by 45\u2009cycles of denaturation (95\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s), annealing (55\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s) and extension (72\u2009\u00b0C for 6\u2009min) followed by final extension at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. DpnI digestion of the parental template was carried out by addition of 3\u2009\u03bcl of DpnI to the reaction mix and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 80\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. 15\u2009\u03bcl of the DpnI digested product was used for transformation of one shot DH5\u03b1 cells (Invitrogen)/XL-Gold competent bacteria. The plates were incubated overnight at 32\u2009\u00b0C. The PB2 and PB1 positive colonies of Bangladesh/2014 and Vietnam/2014 H9N2 were screened by plasmid PCR of the extracted plasmid using Hoffmann primers [31]. The PB1 positive colonies of Jiangxi/2015 were screened by colony PCR using the primers H5N6 PB1F (GAAGTTGGGGGGGAGCGAAAGCAGGC) and H5N6 PB1-R (CATCACATCCTTGAGGAAATCTATTAG) followed by confirmation by plasmid PCR using Hoffmann primers [31]. The desired recombinants were further confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using T7F and bGH R primers.\nFig. 1A schematic representation of the LREI cloning procedure. The technique involves designing primers that incorporate the gene specific untranslated region (UTR) (yellow) and nucleotides homologous to the plasmid pHW2000 (red) multiple cloning site (MCS) to the polymerase coding region resulting in formation of a megaprimer. The viral RNA extracted from the influenza virus (1) can be reverse transcribed by using universal 12 primers (AGCAAAAGCAGG) (2), and the megaprimer can be amplified either from cDNA or any donor plasmid using the primers mentioned in Table 1 (3). Denaturation of the megaprimer generates two primers having complementary ends to the pHW2000 MCS, which when used with a bait plasmid facilitate annealing (4,5). Subsequent thermocycling steps result in extension of the annealed primers (5) thereby synthesizing the non-methylated DNA insert along with the pHW2000 vector as a mixture. DpnI treatment results in digestion of parental methylated DNA, (7) leaving the newly synthesized non-methylated DNA, which can be transformed into E. coli resulting in formation of the desired recombinant plasmid (8)Full size imageVirus rescueA standard influenza virus reverse genetics protocol was followed to rescue influenza viruses [1]. Briefly, 1\u2009\u03bcg of recombinant DNA plasmids carrying Vietnam/2014 virus cDNAs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) and transfected into HEK-293\u2009T cells. At 24\u2009h post-transfection, the HEK-293\u2009T cells were co-cultured with MDCK cells in the presence of TPCK treated trypsin (Sigma). After 72\u2009h post co-culture, presence of rescued recombinant virus in culture supernatants was confirmed by standard Haemagglutination Assay [32] and Plaque Assay [33].ResultsPB2 and PB1 could not be cloned by conventional restriction digestion and ligationThe PB2 and PB1 genes of H5N6 and H9N2 viruses (Table 2) could not be cloned into pHW2000 by standard cloning procedures as mentioned by Hoffmann et al [30]. Either there were no colonies, or the 20\u201340 colonies screened were all negative for the desired insert.Ligation and restriction enzyme independent (LREI) cloning procedure using PA-pHW2000 as a bait plasmid improved the cloning efficiencyThe ligation independent cloning PCR was initially performed by using megaprimers and empty pHW2000 or pHW2000 containing M gene as a bait plasmid. But this didn\u2019t yield any positive colonies after DpnI digestion and transformation. Since, the three polymerase genes (PB2, PB1 and PA) contain same UTR sequences, thus, to improve the annealing efficiency of megaprimer with the bait plasmid, pHW2000 containing PA gene was taken as a bait plasmid (Fig. 1) and cloning PCR steps were performed. Transformation followed by growth of transformed bacteria at 37\u2009\u00b0C resulted in colonies which showed PB2 and PB1 specific bands after screening with PB2 and PB1 specific primers. However, nucleotide sequencing of the plasmids showed some foreign gene insertions, which possibly were inserted by genetic recombination with the bacterial sequence.Growth of recombinant culture at 32\u2009\u00b0C reduced bacterial recombinationTo reduce the bacterial recombination between the desired plasmid and bacterial genome, temperature for growth of the recombinant culture was reduced to 32\u2009\u00b0C from 37\u2009\u00b0C. Colony screening by plasmid PCR (Figs.\u00a02, 3 and 4) showed PB2/PB1 specific colonies and further nucleotide sequencing showed desired PB2 and PB1 inserts without any recombination.\nFig. 2The PB1 positive colonies of Bangladesh/2014 and Vietnam/2014 H9N2 virus were screened by plasmid PCR using the PB1 primers [31]. Out of 16 colonies screened for Bangladesh PB1 (lane 1\u201316), 3 were positive (13, 14, 15; indicated by arrows) while for 9 colonies screened for Vietnam PB1 (lane 17\u201325), 4 were found to be positive (22, 23, 24, 25; indicated by arrows). The positive clones were further confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using T7F and BGHR primers.

Out of 47 colonies screened (lane 1\u201347) for Bangladesh/2014\u2009PB2, 7 were positive in plasmid PCR (indicated by arrows). The positive clones were further confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using T7F and BGHR primers. (+\u2009=\u2009positive control; M\u2009=\u2009DNA marker)Full size imageFig. 4The PB1 colonies of Jiangxi/2015 were screened by colony PCR. A portion of 550\u2009bp of PB1 was amplified using the primers H5N6 PB1F (GAAGTTGGGGGGGAGCGAAAGCAGGC) and H5N6 PB1-R (CATCACATCCTTGAGGAAATCTATTAG). Eight colonies were screened by colony PCR. The positive colonies in colony PCR (indicated by arrows) were further confirmed by plasmid PCR and nucleotide sequencing using T7F and BGHR primers (+\u2009=\u2009positive control; M\u2009=\u2009DNA marker)Full size imageLREI method saves time when cloning involves multiple gene segmentsThe LREI cloning method is faster than the conventional cloning methods due to bypassing the restriction digestion of the insert amplicons and plasmids and the ligation procedures.The cloned plasmids can efficiently be used to generate viruses de-novoTo confirm the functionality of the cloned genes, the plasmids were checked for their ability to rescue influenza virus in-vitro. All the polymerase plasmids were functional and reassortant viruses could be rescued by using the 8 plasmid reverse genetics system.DiscussionHere we developed a novel LREI directional cloning technique which bypasses the restriction digestion step and thus can be employed to increase the cloning efficiency of influenza gene segments having internal restriction sites into pHW2000 vector. The primers (Table 1) were designed to target conserved non-coding region (NCR) of influenza genes such that the approach can be used for targeted cloning of any gene of influenza A virus with the exception of few subtypes of Neuraminidase (NA) due to three nucleotide difference at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends in their NCR [31]. This technique used PCR to create a target amplicon known as a megaprimer with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overhangs. These overhangs are complementary to the cloning site in pHW2000 plasmid and facilitate the annealing of the megaprimer with the template plasmid. Thermocycling was conducted to anneal the megaprimer with pHW2000, which results in the formation of an overloop (Fig. 1). However, to minimise the chances of self-annealing of megaprimers and to increase the chances of annealing with the bait plasmid, a higher concentration of the bait plasmid can be used. DpnI digestion of the parental methylated DNA followed by transformation of the nicked-circular plasmid results in generation of desired recombinant plasmid without involving restriction digestion and DNA ligation. Furthermore, the unique overhang present in the megaprimer results in directional cloning of the desired insert. This was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the cloned plasmids. The LREI cloning strategy allows for the integration of any gene into any site of the vector, provided the same strategy of megaprimer is followed.The pHW2000 vector is a bidirectional plasmid that has RNA PolI and PolII promoters for the generation of influenza vRNA and mRNA. Thus, cloning a cDNA copy of all the gene segments into pHW2000 plasmid and transfection of recombinant plasmids into HEK-293\u2009T cells results in de novo generation of influenza virus [30]. Cloning remains a critical factor for the rapid generation of influenza viruses in vitro. As a proof of principle for establishment of the LREI cloning procedure, we sub-cloned the PB2 gene of Bangladesh/2014 H9N2 and PB1 genes of Vietnam/2014 H9N2, Bangladesh/2014 H9N2, and Jiangxi/2015 H5N6 from pMKT/pMK-RQ vector (GeneArt\u00ae) into the pHW2000 vector. The technique involved choosing a bait plasmid that can assist in formation of a desired recombinant. In the first instance, using empty pHW2000 and pHW2000 vector containing Matrix (M) gene as bait plasmids didn\u2019t result in any colonies being formed, possibly due to instability of the overloop (Fig. 1) [5]. We assumed the size difference between the desired insert and the insert present in the bait plasmid could be a key to generate the desired recombinant plasmid. Since the conserved nucleotides in the UTR of the Polymerase genes are similar, to minimise the size of the overloop formed during the thermocycling with the megaprimer and to maximize the possibility of generation of successful recombinant by cloning PCR, we used pHW2000 containing PA insert as a bait plasmid (Fig. 1 ) [4].While doing LREI cloning, we experienced bacterial recombination in the desired gene, which normally occurs as an outcome of increased metabolic burden on recombinant bacteria, due to concatemer rich sequences in the insert [34, 35] secondary or tertiary structures in the DNA, too low or too high copy number of the plasmid [36], genotype of the competent cells [37, 38], length of the cloned segment or temperature used to grow the culture [39, 40]. Although the exact reason for experiencing difficulties in cloning is difficult to pin point, there seemed to be no convincing role of DNA secondary structures or GC content (data not shown). However, nucleotide blast showed that PB1 gene segments had around 1% sequence homology with the E. coli K-12 genome which is the progenitor of most of the commercially available lab strains of E.coli. Based on the published reports, sequence homology can contribute to homologous recombination leading to deletion/insertions in target insert [41]. Thus, as an effort to reduce the metabolic burden on the transformed bacteria, all the incubation steps involving growth of recombinant bacteria were performed at 32\u2009\u00b0C instead of 37\u2009\u00b0C. Nucleotide sequencing of all the plasmids for target gene inserts further confirmed the presence and sequence orientation of the desired gene and absence of transposable elements. The colonies that carried PB2 and PB1 gene segments were also found to be relatively smaller in size, compared to other colonies which were negative by PCR, suggesting that small colonies likely contain the plasmids that incorporate the correct length PB2 and PB1 gene insert in contrast to the larger size colonies which generally contained empty plasmid or a plasmid with shorter or truncated versions of the gene inserts [26]. This can potentially also be due to the metabolic burden on the recombinant bacteria, which could be associated with the plasmid DNA replication and which eventually leads to reduction in the growth rate of the recombinant bacterial cells [39]. However, growing the recombinant bacteria at 32\u2009\u00b0C doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent the insertion of bacterial sequences into the cloned influenza gene. Although we did not notice any recombination in the polymerase genes grown at 32\u2009\u00b0C in the present study, we have encountered the problem of genetic recombination while doing site-directed mutagenesis of smaller segments like HA and NS even at 32\u2009\u00b0C. This was countered by further reduction of temperatures to 30\u2009\u00b0C or sometimes the recombinant cultures were incubated at room temperature. However, this reduces the bacterial growth in the recombinant culture and can affect the plasmid yield.To confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, LREI cloning was also utilized to clone PB1 of Vietnam 2014 H9N2 by using megaprimer amplified from viral RNA using RT-PCR employing PB1 specific primers (Table 1).Our LREI cloning procedure can efficiently be employed to clone influenza gene segments from field isolates having internal restriction sites for the standard enzymes used in reverse genetics system. The technique has been used to clone the Neuraminidase (NA) gene of a field isolate of H9N2 virus having internal restriction sites for BsaI [42] using pHW2000 containing M gene as a bait plasmid. Likewise, the bait plasmid containing M gene can be used to clone Haemagglutinin (HA) and Nucleoprotein (NP) genes into pHW2000. For cloning of smaller segments like M and Non-Structural (NS) genes, empty pHW2000 vector can be used as a bait plasmid. LREI cloning technique is also quicker and takes less than 2\u2009days for cloning and confirmation of the desired clone (Table\u00a03). Furthermore, the cloned cDNAs could efficiently generate influenza viruses de novo. Thus, our LREI technique is more robust and efficient for de-novo synthesis of influenza viruses and complements the 8 plasmid reverse genetics system.\nTable 3 Comparison of relative time taken by LREI cloning compared to conventional cloningFull size tableVarious strategies for cloning have been reported, which include: TA cloning [43], GATEWAY recombinational cloning [44], CloneEZ one step cloning [45], and cloning by overlap extension PCR [46]. Each method has its own limitations e.g. TA cloning using standard Taq DNA Polymerase may result in point mutations in the amplicon during PCR amplification of the desired amplicon and further required specific sequences to create overhangs that would facilitate cloning procedures. Another technique called Gateway recombinational cloning requires DNA recombination to transfer DNA between donor and destination vectors, but this requires additional sequences for recombination. CloneEZ kits use sticky ends in the vector and insert for cloning but linearization of vector by restriction digestion is required.Like LREI, another approach involving the use of ccdB gene as a selection marker has also been used to insert the influenza PB2 and PB1 genes into the pHWSccdB vector [47]. Our approach neither requires any selection marker nor is there any requirement for modification of pHW2000 vector. Similarly, many novel approaches to molecular cloning including Homologous recombination [48, 49], PLICing [50] and use of Zinc finger nucleases [51] have been proposed in recent years that also don\u2019t require restriction enzymes. Many researchers have reported similar strategies of DNA cloning by PCR which include restriction site-free cloning [52], restriction free cloning [53], cloning by overlap extension PCR [46] and MEGAWHOP cloning [54].Our LREI cloning technique is based on exponential amplification of a megaprimer and the targeted vector, which results in a greater number of positive colonies after transformation compared to the conventional cloning strategies. This technique is specific and highly efficient in generation of cloned plasmids, which are otherwise difficult to clone. LREI cloning increases the chances of formation of recombinant clones and growth of recombinant bacteria at lower temperatures alleviates the problem of genetic recombination, albeit at the cost of plasmid yield. In summary, this technique can be applied to clone all influenza gene segments using universal primers, which would help in rapid generation of influenza viruses and make the study of influenza virus biology easier.ConclusionThe LREI cloning procedure represents an alternative strategy for cloning influenza gene segments which have internal restriction sites for the enzymes used in reverse genetics. Further, the problem of genetic instability in bacteria encountered in influenza gene segments can be alleviated by growing recombinant bacterial cultures at a lower temperature. This technique can be applied to clone any influenza gene segment using universal primers, which would help in rapid generation of influenza viruses and facilitate influenza research and vaccine development.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe authors are happy to share any data or material upon request.\nAbbreviationsLREI:\nLigation and Restriction Enzyme Independent\nRG:\nReverse Genetics\nMCS:\nMultiple Cloning Site\nUTR:\nUn-translated Region\nPB2:\nPolymerase Basic 2\nPB1:\nPolymerase Basic 1\nPA:\nPolymerase Acidic\nHA:\nHaemagglutinin\nNP:\nNucleoprotein\nNA:\nNeuraminidase\nM:\nMatrix\nNS:\nNon-structural \n "}
{"text": "Plasmid-Based Reverse Genetics of Influenza A Virus. \n Abstract \n Reverse genetics is the process of generating an RNA virus from a cDNA copy. Reverse genetics systems have truly transformed our ability to manipulate and study negative-strand RNA viruses. Plasmid-based reverse genetics approaches for influenza viruses provide a better understanding of virulence, transmission, mechanisms of antiviral resistance, and the development of alternative vaccines and vaccination strategies. Studying the molecular changes that allow influenza A viruses (IAVs) to transmit among animal species is important to better understand their animal health and public health risks. In this chapter, the cloning of cDNA copies of IAV\u2019s RNA segments into a reverse genetics plasmid vector, the experimental procedures for studying viral polymerase activity, and the successful generation of recombinant IAVs are described.Key wordsInfluenza A virusPlasmid-based reverse geneticsVirus rescueSecreted alkaline phosphataseBidirectional plasmids\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDownload protocol PDF\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpringer Nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate Protocols.\u00a0Learn more\n\n\n1 IntroductionInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) are single-stranded\n\n, negative-sense RNA viruses with a segmented genome that belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family [1]. IAVs contain 8 viral gene segments, which encode at least 12 viral proteins. Two surface proteins, the trimeric hemagglutinin (HA) and the tetrameric neuraminidase (NA), are the main antigenic determinants of the virus to which neutralizing antibodies are elicited. IAVs are classified by the antigenic properties of the HA and NA. Currently, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been described [2, 3]. Reverse genetics (RG), a technology that generates genetically defined RNA viruses from a cDNA copy, has become instrumental in the understanding of IAV host switching, receptor binding, and virulence [4,5,6,7].Plasmid-based reverse genetics (RG) systems for IAV must provide two types of RNAs: (1) negative-sense, genomic viral RNA copies of each viral segment (vRNAs) and (2) messenger RNA copies (mRNAs) for the structural components of the virus, particularly the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, which is comprised of three polymerase subunits, PB1, PB2, and PA, and the nucleoprotein (NP). Many plasmid-based and vector-based systems have been developed for IAVs [8]. However, the most convenient system consists of eight plasmids in which cDNA copies of each viral segment are cloned under the control of RNA polymerase I (pol I) and II (pol II) promoters cloned in opposite directions to drive expression of both vRNA and mRNA, respectively, from the same plasmid (Figs. 1 and 2) [9].Fig. 1Generation of influenza A virus by plasmid-based reverse genetics. Typical reverse genetics systems for influenza viruses require the cloning of cDNA copies of each vRNA segment into suitable vectors. The figure depicts one of the most versatile cloning vectors with bidirectional promoters [15]. Rescue of influenza virus de novo requires the production of vRNAs and viral proteins (particularly RNA polymerase subunits and NP) from host-derived DNA-dependent RNA polymerase complexes. The expression of vRNAs requires promoters with exact 5\u2032 initiation and 3\u2032 stop sites, like the human RNA polymerase I promoter (pol I). Viral protein synthesis is achieved with the use of RNA polymerase II promoters (pCMV or others)Full size imageFig. 2Plasmid pDP2002 vector for reverse genetics. Reverse genetics vectors vary with respect to the species of origin of the RNA polymerase I promoter and the sequence of the cloning site into which cDNA segments of influenza are ligated. Site of cloning contains a 444\u00a0nt spacer flanked by BsmBI sitesFull size imageIn eukaryotic cells, the RNA pol I complex produces uncapped ribosomal RNA, but in this RG system, it is utilized to generate the vRNAs. Transcription is terminated with the (murine) RNA polymerase I terminator (T-1), also known as Sal I box, to produce vRNAs with defined start and stop sites. Transcription of viral mRNAs is typically achieved from an RNA polymerase II (pol II) promoter element upstream of cloned viral cDNA and expressed in a manner similar to host mRNAs [10].In this chapter, we describe the details on the use of a replicon system to study influenza virus polymerase activity and the procedures for virus rescue using the 8-plasmid RG system with bidirectional promoters as described by Hoffman et al. [9] with minor modifications. Minor variations in the procedures can be found elsewhere [11, 12].The plasmid utilized here, pDP2002 (Fig. 2), is a derivative of pHW2000 [9] in which a 444\u00a0nt spacer sequence was cloned between two BsmBI sites in order to easily discern the double-digested vector for the purpose of cloning full-length IAV cDNAs (see Note 1). The pDP2002 plasmid contains the RNA pol I and II transcription units in opposite orientations. The first unit contains the human RNA polymerase I promoter (hpol I) and the murine polymerase I transcription terminator (T-1) for the synthesis of vRNAs. The second unit drives viral mRNA transcription from the RNA polymerase II-driven cytomegalovirus (pCMV) promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (aBGH). IAV cDNAs are cloned into the RG vector using restriction sites artificially engineered at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of each segment in a manner compatible with the RG vector.Downstream procedures to characterize the rescued virus, such as virus amplification in embryonating chicken eggs (ECE), hemagglutination (HA) assays, plaque assays, and/or other in vitro characterization methods that are the same as those applied for characterization of field strains, are described elsewhere in this book.2 Materials2.1 General Laboratory Equipment and Supplies\n\n\n1.\nCertified biosafety cabinet.\n\n\n2.\nCell culture incubators with CO2.\n\n\n3.\nEgg incubators (optional).\n\n\n4.\nLow- to medium-speed swinging-bucket centrifuge.\n\n\n5.\nSwinging-bucket rotors and adapters for appropriate tubes.\n\n\n6.\nMicro-centrifuge with a rotor capable of reaching up to 12,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g.\n\n\n7.\nThermal cycler and compatible tubes (PCR tubes).\n\n\n8.\nHeat block and/or water bath.\n\n\n9.\nUltralow temperature freezer.\n\n\n10.\nSpectrophotometer.\n\n\n11.\nAgarose electrophoresis equipment.\n\n\n12.\nAgarose LE, analytical grade for molecular biology applications.\n\n\n13.\nEthidium bromide or similar DNA stain.\n\n\n14.\nCell counter or hemocytometer.\n\n\n15.\nCell culture media and supplies for the appropriate cell line.\n\n\n16.\nInverted microscope.\n\n\n17.\nStandard molecular biology supplies (e.g., 1.5\u00a0mL micro-centrifuge tubes, vortex, 50\u00a0mL centrifuge tubes, pipets, and aerosol-resistant tips).\n\n\n18.\nSterile, cell culture grade PBS.\n\n\n19.\nSterile serological pipets.\n\n\n20.\nRNA grade water.\n\n\n21.\nAntibiotic/antimycotic solution (10,000\u00a0units/mL penicillin G, 10\u00a0mg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL amphotericin B).\n\n\n22.\nIce.\n\n\n2.2 Influenza A vRNA Extraction\n\n\n1.\nIAV isolate.\n\n\n2.\nRNA extraction kit.\n\n\n3.\nRNA grade water (i.e., RNase-free or DEPC-treated ddH2O).\n\n\n2.3 cDNA Synthesis\n\n\n1.\nUniversal (Uni)-12 primer (see Table 1).\n\n\n2.\nAvian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (RT) and buffer.\n\n\n3.\nRNasin (40\u00a0U/\u03bcL).\n\n\n4.\ndNTP mix (2.5\u00a0mM).\n\n\nTable 1 Oligonucleotides for cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing of influenza A virus reverse genetics\n\n\n\n systemFull size table\n2.4 Amplification of Influenza A vRNAs\n\n\n1.\nInfluenza A virus primer set for cloning into pDP2002 (see Table 1).\n\n\n2.\nHigh-fidelity polymerase.\n\n\n3.\ndNTPs (20\u00a0mM).\n\n\n4.\nAgarose gel purification kit.\n\n\n2.5 Cloning Influenza A cDNAs\n\n\n1.\nBsmBI, BsaI, AarI, and BbsI restriction enzymes.\n\n\n2.\nT4 DNA ligase.\n\n\n3.\nChemically competent E. coli cells (e.g., Top10 or DH10B).\n\n\n4.\nSuper optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC) media.\n\n\n5.\nLB agar plates containing 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL ampicillin.\n\n\n6.\nPCR mix and primers (see Table 1).\n\n\n7.\nAgarose gel purification kit.\n\n\n8.\nPCR DNA purification kit.\n\n\n9.\nSterile screw cap vials (1.5\u20132.0\u00a0mL).\n\n\n10.\nSterile toothpicks (optional).\n\n\n11.\nCell spreaders.\n\n\n12.\nShaker-incubator.\n\n\n13.\nPlasmid maxi-prep kit.\n\n\n14.\npDP2002 plasmid.\n\n\n2.6 Generation of IAV by Reverse Genetics\n\n\n1.\nHuman embryonic kidney HEK293T (HEK293T) cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, CRL-11268) (see Note 2).\n\n\n2.\nMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34).

Most institutions require inspections and approvals of laboratories prior to conducting work with infectious disease agents. Prior to engaging in RG-based studies with IAVs, consult with local biosafety officials on the type of biocontainment required at your institution. Follow appropriate biosafety and biosecurity practices, rules, and regulations for this type of work. Check with your institution for biosafety requirements. All materials used for the rescue of IAVs should be sterilized before disposal. Generation of aerosols while working with IAVs must be prevented. Adequately maintain and inspect equipment dedicated to work with IAVs.Also, because of the sensitivity of these procedures, it is important to take special care to prevent cross-contamination. Use good aseptic technique, use aerosol barrier pipet tips, use tips only once, change gloves frequently, and disinfect the work area before and after use.3.2 Extraction of IAV vRNADedicated equipment, supplies, and reagents solely for RNA work are highly recommended. RNA is easily degraded if proper handling techniques are not followed. Precautions for handling RNA samples include purchasing reagents that are free of RNases, separating reagents and materials for RNA work only, and wearing RNase-free gloves. Disposable gloves must be worn at all times while handling RNA samples to avoid RNA degradation. Change gloves frequently. RNA samples should be kept on ice throughout the entire extraction procedure and preferably should be used immediately for cDNA synthesis. Remaining RNA sample material can be kept frozen at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C. Typically, RNA samples stored for more than a month are discarded.Extract the viral RNA from the target IAV with any standard method or kit on accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (e.g., a silica-based or organic-based reagent), following procedures recommended by the manufacturer (see Note 5). Viral titers \u2265106 50% tissue culture infectious doses or \u2265107 50% egg infectious doses are typically required for efficient preparation of viral RNAs and subsequent RT-PCR amplification. Virus isolation from clinical samples, in tissue culture, for example, MDCK cells or ECE at 10\u00a0days of incubation, is recommended in order to obtain appropriate quantities of viral RNA for downstream steps. The viral RNAs should be eluted/resuspended in RNA grade water. Quantify the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer; note that the viral RNA in only a portion of the RNA is present.3.3 cDNA Synthesis Using Purified Influenza A vRNA\n\n\n1.\nCombine in a 1.5\u00a0mL micro-centrifuge tube: 4.0\u00a0\u03bcL RNA (prepared in Subheading. 3.1); 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL Uni-12 primer (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg); and 5.5\u00a0\u03bcL RNA grade water.\n\n\n2.\nIncubate at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min.\n\n\n3.\nImmediately transfer to ice.\n\n\n4.\nIncubate on ice for 2\u00a0min.\n\n\n5.\nPulse-spin in micro-centrifuge to collect contents at the bottom of the tube (<1\u00a0min).\n\n\n6.\nPut the tube back on ice.\n\n\n7.\nIn a separate 1.5\u00a0mL micro-centrifuge tube, prepare the reverse transcriptase (RT) master mix by adding the following components (volumes are per sample; prepare 10% extra to account for pipetting error): 4.0\u00a0\u03bcL 2.5\u00a0mM dNTPs; 4.0\u00a0\u03bcL 5\u00d7 reverse transcriptase buffer (if buffer is not 5\u00d7, adjust the volume as appropriate) (see Note 3); 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL RNasin, 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL AMV reverse transcriptase.\n\n\n8.\nMix well; pulse-spin to collect contents.\n\n\n9.\nAdd 10\u00a0\u03bcL of the RT master mix to each RNA sample.\n\n\n10.\nIncubate at 42\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u20132\u00a0h.\n\n\n11.\nHeat-inactivate the RT enzyme at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min.\n\n\n3.4 PCR Amplification of Full-Length Influenza A Viral cDNAsFor full-length amplification of IAV gene segments from cDNA copies, reliable results have been obtained using either the Expand High-Fidelity PCR system (Roche) or Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC buffer (NEB) (see Note 3). Segment-specific primers are listed in Table 1. Forward and reverse primers contain sequences complementary to the viral segment and 5\u2032 extensions encoding either BsmBI, BsaI, AarI, or BbsI sites for cloning purposes (see Note 6).\n\n1.\nFor each segment to be amplified, prepare a PCR tube with the following: 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL cDNA; 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL forward primer (150\u00a0ng); and 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL reverse primer (150\u00a0ng). Select the primers from Table 1 based on the target segment.\n\n\n2.\nIn a micro-centrifuge tube, add the following to prepare the amplification mixture (volumes are per sample; prepare 10% extra to account for pipetting error): 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL 20\u00a0mM dNTPs; 5.0\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00d7 buffer; 0.75\u00a0\u03bcL polymerase (e.g., Expand HF [Roche] or Phusion for high GC [NEB]); and 39.25\u00a0\u03bcL RNA grade water.\n\n\n3.\nAdd 46\u00a0\u03bcL of the amplification mixture to the PCR tube with the primers and cDNA. Use proper techniques to avoid cross-contaminating the samples. Set the thermal cycler with the following parameters: For PA, PB1, PB2, and HA genes, use 94\u00a0\u00b0C 4\u00a0min; 30\u00a0cycles of 94\u00a0\u00b0C 20\u00a0s, 56\u00a0\u00b0C 30\u00a0s, and 72\u00a0\u00b0C 7\u00a0min; and a final extension step of 72\u00a0\u00b0C 10\u00a0min; hold at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. For NP, NA, M, and NS genes, use 94\u00a0\u00b0C 4\u00a0min; 30\u00a0cycles of 94\u00a0\u00b0C 20\u00a0s, 56\u00a0\u00b0C 30\u00a0s, and 72\u00a0\u00b0C 5\u00a0min; and a final extension of 72\u00a0\u00b0C 10\u00a0min; hold at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Run the PCR.\n\n\n4.\nConfirm amplification by standard 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and purify the PCR products with a gel extraction kit. Elute in 27\u00a0\u03bcL elution buffer or RNA grade water. After elution, PCR products can be quantified using a spectrophotometer. PCR reactions and gel-extracted products can be stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C until further use (see Note 7).\n\n3.5 Cloning Influenza A Viral cDNAs Into pDP20023.5.1 Cloning Reaction\n\n\n1.\nAfter completing the previous procedures, there should be eight PCR products and one cDNA copy of each full-length IAV segments flanked by the appropriate restriction sites. These will be cloned into the corresponding RG vector.\n\n\n2.\nPrepare the plasmids using a commercially available plasmid maxi-prep kit, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Store plasmids at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C at a concentration of 0.25\u20131.0\u00a0mg/mL. It is recommended that plasmid stocks are diluted into working stocks at a concentration of 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL prior to transfection to minimize pipetting errors and to standardize volumes for each plasmid.\n\n\n3.\nPerform a restriction enzyme digestion of each of the PCR products. To a clean micro-centrifuge tube, add the following: 26.0\u00a0\u03bcL of eluted PCR product; 3.0\u00a0\u03bcL of the appropriate restriction enzyme buffer (if the buffer is not 10\u00d7, adjust the volume accordingly); and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL of the appropriate restriction enzyme (BsmBI, BsaI, AarI, or BbsI).\n\n\n4.\nIncubate for a minimum of 4\u00a0h (the digestion can be incubated overnight) at the appropriate temperature for the enzyme. Incubate in a thermal cycler, heat block, or water bath. If using a water bath, note potential excessive evaporation which condenses on the lid during long incubation periods; pulse-spin the tube frequently to maintain the correct concentration of reagents in the reaction; this prevents restriction digestion problems. The digested fragment is purified using a PCR purification kit for small volumes. Elute in 10\u00a0\u03bcL of elution buffer. Further purification by agarose gel is not necessary after digestion.\n\n\n5.\nDigest the vector, pDP2002, with the BsmBI restriction enzyme: 8.0\u00a0\u03bcL pDP2002 (~800\u00a0ng); 6.0\u00a0\u03bcL buffer 3; 2.0\u00a0\u03bcL BsmBI enzyme; and 44.0\u00a0\u03bcL RNA grade water.\n\n\n6.\nIncubate at 55\u00a0\u00b0C from 3\u00a0h to overnight in a thermal cycler or heating block. Run the digested products on a 1% agarose gel. Two major bands should be seen, one at about ~0.4\u00a0kb corresponding to the spacer region and one at ~2.9\u00a0kb corresponding to the vector. If the vector has been digested at a single BsmBI site, a band of ~3.4\u00a0kb should be seen. Only the 2.9\u00a0kb band should be used for cloning. Purify the fragment using a gel extraction kit. Elute the vector in 30\u00a0\u03bcL buffer. If using ethidium bromide, don\u2019t add the ethidium bromide to the gel; this can cause mutations in the vector resulting in defective clones. It is best to run the gel without ethidium bromide followed by incubation of the gel for 15\u00a0min in ethidium bromide solution (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) once the run has been completed.\n\n\n7.\nLigate the vector and each insert by combining in a micro-centrifuge tube the following: 5.0\u00a0\u03bcL digested PCR product (~180\u00a0ng) (RNA grade water is used as a negative control); 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL digested pDP2002 plasmid (~40\u00a0ng); 7.5\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00d7 ligase buffer; and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcL Quick T4 DNA ligase (if using another T4 ligase, adjust volumes as appropriate).\n\n\n8.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5\u00a0min; then immediately put on ice. The ligation reaction can be stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C. During the 5\u00a0min incubation time, remove one tube of E. coli competent cells from \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C and thaw on ice (see Note 8). Also, allow the SOC medium to reach room temperature if it is maintained frozen or refrigerated.\n\n\n9.\nAdd 25\u00a0\u03bcL competent cells and 2\u00a0\u03bcL of the ligation reaction to a sterile 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0mL screw cap vial; mix well by stirring with the pipet tip (do not pipet up and down to mix because it can decrease the viability of the chemically competent E. coli cells). Incubate on ice for 30\u00a0min.\n\n\n10.\nTransform the E. coli competent cells by heat shocking at 42\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s; then immediately put the tube on ice for 2\u00a0min.\n\n\n11.\nAdd 250\u00a0\u03bcL SOC medium, and incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 45\u00a0min to 1\u00a0h in a shaker-incubator. Shake at approximately 200\u00a0rpm.\n\n\n12.\nWhile the cells are incubating in the shaker, warm the LB/ampicillin agar plates. If the LB/ampicillin agar plates have been kept at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, it is possible that there may be moisture from condensation on the agar surface. Excess moisture can affect plating the bacterial cells evenly. To prevent this, place the LB agar plates inside a biosafety cabinet with the lids open to let them air-dry.\n\n\n13.\nUsing a sterile cell spreader, spread the entire SOC/competent cell/ligation suspension on the LB/ampicillin agar plate. Place the plate in the 37\u00a0\u00b0C incubator for 16\u201318\u00a0h with the agar side up and the lid side down. The next day, colonies should be visible to the naked eye containing potentially positive clones. A PCR reaction can be performed on colonies using appropriate set of primers to screen for positive clones (Table 1) (see Note 9).\n\n\n3.5.2 PCR Screening of Colonies for Positive Clones\n\n\n1.\nPrepare a PCR master mix. For each reaction, include the following: 0.6\u00a0\u03bcL Seq pol I primer (Table 1) (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL); 0.6\u00a0\u03bcL Seq T7 primer (Table 1) (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL); 0.4\u00a0\u03bcL 50\u00d7 dNTPs (20\u00a0mM); 2.0\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00d7 buffer A; 0.25\u00a0\u03bcL Taq polymerase; and 16.5\u00a0\u03bcL RNA grade water.\n\n\n2.\nMix by vortexing for 10\u00a0s at medium speed, and centrifuge briefly to collect contents to the bottom of the tube. Maintain the master mix on ice. Distribute 20\u00a0\u03bcL of PCR master mix/reaction into prechilled PCR tubes. Add Taq polymerase last and maintain tubes on ice until ready for PCR reaction.\n\n\n3.\nUsing a sterile pipet tip or sterile toothpick, pick bacterial colonies which are about 1.5\u20133\u00a0mm in diameter. The colonies will serve as the PCR template (see Note 10).\n\n\n4.\nPipet the colony up and down into PCR tubes containing 20\u00a0\u03bcL PCR master mix, vortex briefly, centrifuge to spin down contents, and put on ice.\n\n\n5.\nSet the thermal cycler with the following parameters: 94\u00a0\u00b0C 5\u00a0min; 30\u00a0cycles of 94\u00a0\u00b0C 30\u00a0s, 55\u00a0\u00b0C 30\u00a0s, and 72\u00a0\u00b0C 5\u00a0min; and a final extension step of 72\u00a0\u00b0C 10\u00a0min; hold at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Run the PCR.\n\n\n6.\nOnce the PCR reaction is complete, load 5\u00a0\u03bcL of the PCR product on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide (0.2\u20130.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) to detect clones carrying clones of the correct size (see Note 11).\n\n\n7.\nOnce the appropriate influenza A RG plasmid set has been obtained, high-quality plasmid DNA (pDNA) preparations for mammalian transfection are needed. It is recommended to use an endonuclease-free maxi-prep DNA kit following the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Plasmid DNA (pDNA) concentrations are determined using a spectrophotometer. Typical pDNA concentrations range from 0.25 to 1.0\u00a0mg/mL. We recommend keeping plasmid DNA stocks at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C and preparing working solutions at 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL of each plasmid in order to preserve consistency and to avoid pipetting errors. It is also recommended that, prior to each transfection, the integrity of plasmid DNAs be evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis (see Note 12).\n\n\n3.6 Generation of IAV by Reverse GeneticsThe following procedure is very simple but also prone to cross-contamination. Use extreme care when handling cells, transfection reagents, plasmids, and media. Use aerosol barrier pipet tips throughout this procedure to prevent contamination. Only use a pipet tip once. The procedure below is described for performing transfections using a 6-well plate format and co-cultured HEK293T/MDCK cells. It is also amenable for scaling down to 12- and 24-well plate formats. Reducing the well size decreases the number of cells available for transfection; therefore, recovery of virus is less efficient.HEK293T cells and MDCK cells are routinely grown in T-75 flasks and maintained in DMEM complete culture media. Prior to working with cells, pre-warm PBS and cell culture media to 37\u00a0\u00b0C.3.6.1 Cell Preparation\n\n\n1.\nApproximately 24\u00a0h prior to transfection, wash freshly confluent HEK293T and MDCK cell once or twice with 5\u00a0mL BS or medium without FBS.\n\n\n2.\nIncubate with 10\u00a0mL trypsin-EDTA (20\u201345\u00a0min for MDCK cells, 1\u00a0min for HEK293T cells).\n\n\n3.\nTransfer the cells from the flask using disposable, sterile serological pipets into a 15\u00a0mL conical centrifuge tube.\n\n\n4.\nCentrifuge for 5\u00a0min at low speed 500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g in swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge.\n\n\n5.\nDiscard the supernatant by removing it with a serological pipet.\n\n\n6.\nResuspend the cells in 10\u00a0mL Opti-MEM I-AB.\n\n\n7.\nRemove 1\u00a0mL of each cell line and mix together in 18\u00a0mL Opti-MEM I-AB for a total of 20\u00a0mL. Mix well. A HEK293T/MDCK cell ratio of 1:1 to 5:1 can be used.\n\n\n8.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Consistent virus rescue results are obtained when HEK293T cells are seeded at 4.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/well and MDCK cells are seeded at 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/well in this co-cultured format (4.5:1 ratio). Add 3\u00a0mL of the cell suspension to each well of a 6-well plate.\n\n\n3.6.2 Transfection\n\n\n1.\nApproximately 16\u201324\u00a0h after the cells are plated, prepare a mixture of eight plasmids (one plasmid per influenza viral RNA gene segment) (see Note 13). In a 1.5\u00a0mL micro-centrifuge tube, add 10\u00a0\u03bcL of each plasmid (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) (1\u00a0\u03bcg of each plasmid, 8\u00a0\u03bcg pDNA total for all eight plasmids); add 20\u00a0\u03bcL of Opti-MEM I (1:2.5 ratio). Mix well. The tube should now contain 100\u00a0\u03bcL.\n\n\n2.\nIn a separate micro-centrifuge tube, prepare 85\u00a0\u03bcL of Opti-MEM I and add 16\u00a0\u03bcL of TransIT-LT1 (2\u00a0\u03bcL/\u03bcg of plasmid DNA). The tube should now contain 100\u00a0\u03bcL. The Opti-MEM I/ TransIT-LT1 can be prepared as a master mix for all the transfections that will be performed at a time (prepare 10% extra). Mix by vortexing.\n\n\n3.\nAdd 100\u00a0\u03bcL Opti-MEM I/TransIT-LT1 mixture to the plasmid DNA/Opti-MEM I mixture. Mix well.\n\n\n4.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for approximately 45\u00a0min; then add 800\u00a0\u03bcL of Opti-MEM I-AB.\n\n\n5.\nRemove the medium from the cells in the 6-well plates; add the transfection mixture to the cells. It is not necessary to wash the cells prior to the addition of the transfection mixture. Use caution when adding transfection mixture onto the cells. It is best to place the pipet tip as close as possible to the cell monolayer, and pipet the material slowly (drop by drop) to help prevent aerosols. Incubate the cells for 6\u201312\u00a0h in 5% CO2 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n6.\nAfter 6\u201312\u00a0h, remove the transfection mixture from the cells (very slowly), add 1\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM I-AB to the cells, and incubate in 5% CO2 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u201318 additional hours (a total of 24\u00a0h after completing step 5). Tilting the plate slightly, insert a pipet and hold the tip against the wall of the well where the media is deepest, and pipet the liquid up slowly until most of the medium has been removed. It is not necessary to wash the cells after this step before going into the next step.\n\n\n7.\nAt 24\u00a0h post transfection (hpt), add 2\u00a0mL of Opti-MEM I-AB containing 1.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin to the cells (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL final concentration).\n\n\n8.\nStarting at about 48\u201372\u00a0h post transfection, monitor the cells for cytopathic effects (CPE), particularly the MDCK cells (see Note 14). The CPE are small foci of dead cells indicative of active IAV replication and may become apparent for some, but not all, successful virus rescues.\n\n\n9.\nRegardless of whether CPE are observed at approximately 72\u00a0h post transfection, transfer 1\u00a0mL of the cell culture supernatant to a micro-centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 2400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min.\n\n\n10.\nTo enrich any rescued virus, conduct a blind passage in MDCK cells: Transfer 900\u00a0\u03bcL of the supernatant from step 9 to a new tube. Add 500\u00a0\u03bcL to each well of a 12-well plate of MDCK cells for a blind passage. Incubate the supernatant with MDCK cells for 1\u00a0h at room temperature, remove the supernatant, and add virus growth medium containing 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of TPCK-trypsin. Monitor for the development of CPE, which indicates IAV replication. The supernatant may also be tested for hemagglutination by hemagglutination assay 48\u201372\u00a0h post inoculated (see Chapter 1). Wells with CPE and/or which have supernatant that is positive for hemagglutination indicate IAV replication.\n\n\n11.\nThe rescued RG virus can either be stored at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C or may be further amplified in either MDCK cells or 8- to 10-day-old ECE in order to produce virus stocks. Details on virus amplification and characterization are addressed in other chapters (see Note 15).\n\n\n3.7 Analysis of Viral Polymerase ActivityIt is well-accepted that mutations in the proteins encoding the IAV\u2019s polymerase complex have an impact on host range. Such mutations usually result in differences in levels of polymerase activity in cells derived from different animal species or grown at different temperatures [13]. A polymerase complex derived from an IAV strain of avian origin is usually more active at elevated temperatures (39\u201341\u00a0\u00b0C) than IAVs isolated from humans which \u201cprefer\u201d lower temperatures (35\u201337\u00a0\u00b0C). Alternatively, zoonotic IAV strains of avian origin may carry mutations that allow them to maintain optimal polymerase activity at lower temperatures, similar to a human-derived strain. Thus, studying polymerase activity using a replicon assay, a trimmed version of the 8-plasmid RG system, is useful to determine the effects on mutations on virus replication [14]. The reader is encouraged to visit the literature to learn more about the different options regarding this type of assays [13].The method below (Fig. 3) utilizes a plasmid encoding an IAV replicon containing a copy of the Gaussia Luciferase (Gluc) gene in the negative sense flanked by the untranslated regions (UTR) of the IAV\u2019s NS segment (segment 8) under the control of the hpol I promoter and T1 terminator (pGluc-NS). Co-transfection of this plasmid with four additional expression plasmids encoding each polymerase subunit (PB1, PB2, PA) and the NP under the control of an RNA pol II promoter results in amplification of the NSGluc replicon. Subsequent expression of the Gluc protein results in luciferase activity that can be measured with a commercially available kit. Variations in transfection efficiencies are accounted for by normalizing relative Gluc activity against a transfection reporter control, a plasmid encoding the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) under an RNA pol II promoter.Fig. 3Diagram for polymerase activity assay. The figure depicts a typical replicon assay to measure IAV polymerase activity. IAV\u2019s P-complex and NP-encoding expression plasmids under an RNA pol II expression result in the expression of the viral polymerase complex. The vRNA replicon contains the Gluc gene in the negative sense flanked by the UTR of the NS segment under the control of an RNA pol I promoter. Inside the transfected cells, the viral polymerase complex recognizes the vRNA Gluc replicon, resulting in transcription/replication and consequent Gluc expression, whose activity is proportional to the activity of the polymerase control. A transfection control is included, an expression plasmid encoding the SEAP gene under the control of an RNA pol II promoter. Gluc and SEAP activities are measured using commercially available kits in a luminometerFull size image3.7.1 Preparation of Cells\n\n\n1.\nAbout 24\u00a0h prior to transfection, carefully aspirate the media off a freshly confluent layer of HEK293T cells.\n\n\n2.\nWash the cells with 5\u00a0mL of PBS. Carefully aspirate the PBS off the cells.\n\n\n3.\nAdd 2\u20133\u00a0mL trypsin-EDTA to the cells and incubate in 5% CO2 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min.\n\n\n4.\nTap the flask to detach cells from the flask, and then inactivate the trypsin-EDTA with 2\u20133\u00a0mL of growth media.\n\n\n5.\nPipet the cells up and down slowly with a sterile serological pipet to get a well-dispersed cell suspension.\n\n\n6.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a sterile tube.\n\n\n7.\nCount the cells using an automatic cell counter or hemocytometer. To use a hemocytometer, in a 1.5\u00a0mL micro-centrifuge tube, add 900\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS and 100\u00a0\u03bcL of cells. Load 10\u00a0\u03bcL of mix to hemocytometer and count the number of live cells using an inverted microscope.\n\n\n8.\nPlate the cells with growth media in a 24-well plate at a density where the cells are ~60\u201370% confluent the next day (approximately 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/mL in a well). Generally, three replicates (i.e., 3-well) should be plated per group, as well as negative control wells with only cells for background controls.\n\n\n9.\nIncubate cells with 5% CO2 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight.\n\n\n3.7.2 Transfection of Cells\n\n\n1.\nThe cells will be transfected approximately 16\u201324\u00a0h after the cells are plated (see Subheading 3.7.1). Prepare the plasmid transfection mixture: Mix 1\u00a0\u03bcg each of plasmid encoding the PB2, PB1, PA, NP, pGluc-NS, and pCMV-SEAP in a 1.5\u00a0mL micro-centrifuge tube. Cells transfected with an empty plasmid vector serve as the negative control. To generate the negative control, replace one of the polymerase-complex plasmids or the NP plasmid with 1\u00a0\u03bcg of an empty plasmid vector. A \u201cbackground\u201d luciferase activity control is generated by transfecting 6\u00a0\u03bcg of an empty plasmid vector. This is to ensure that the same amount of DNA is transfected among all samples and controls.\n\n\n2.\nIn a separate tube, prepare the transfection mixture. Use 2\u00a0\u03bcL per 1\u00a0\u03bcg of DNA of TransIT-LT1 (e.g., for 6\u00a0\u03bcg DNA, use 12\u00a0\u03bcL TransIT-LT1), and bring the total volume to 100\u00a0\u03bcL with Opti-MEM I (e.g., 12\u00a0\u03bcL TransIT-LT1 and 60\u00a0\u03bcL of DNA the total volume if 72\u00a0\u03bcL; therefore, 28\u00a0\u03bcL of Opti-MEM is needed for a volume of 100\u00a0\u03bcL). Vortex lightly and then add to the tube containing the plasmid mixture.\n\n\n3.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for 45\u00a0min.\n\n\n4.\nSlowly add 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the transfection mixture to the cells. Do not wash the cells or remove the media. Once all of the transfection mixture has been added, there should be 1.1\u00a0mL of liquid media in each well.\n\n\n5.\nIncubate cells in 5% CO2 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n6.\nCollect 100\u00a0\u03bcL of cell culture supernatant at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96\u00a0h post transfection (hpt) into a fresh 1.5\u00a0mL tube at each time point. Replenish each time with 100\u00a0\u03bcL of fresh growth media to maintain constant volume of media (1.1\u00a0mL) on the cells.\n\n\n7.\nImmediately after collection, store the 100\u00a0\u03bcL samples at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until all samples are collected at the end of the experiment.\n\n\n3.7.3 Measurement of Gluc Activity\n\n\n1.\nThaw the samples on ice.\n\n\n2.\nPrepare the Gluc working solution for all the sample by adding coelenterazine (kit supplied) to the Gaussia Luciferase Glow Assay buffer immediately before performing the assay (prepare enough for the number of samples being tested according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions). The Gluc substrate is light-sensitive. Wrap aluminum foil around the tube to protect the Gluc assay solution from light or use a light proof tube.\n\n\n3.\nMix well by inverting the tube several times.\n\n\n4.\nPipet 20\u00a0\u03bcL of the tissue culture supernatant sample from step 15 into a 96-well white plate.\n\n\n5.\nSet the luminometer for 2\u201310\u00a0s of integration.\n\n\n6.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL of the Gluc working solution to each sample.\n\n\n7.\nPlace each plate in the luminometer and wait for 10\u00a0min for signal stabilization.\n\n\n8.\nMeasure for 0.1\u20131\u00a0s/well. The entire plate can be measured at once.\n\n\n9.\nNormalize the luciferase activity by using an internal control such as SEAP.\n\n\n3.7.4 Normalization with SEAP 12\u00a0h Post Transfection\n\n\n1.\nThaw samples on ice.\n\n\n2.\nEquilibrate the assay buffer (50\u00a0\u03bcL/well) and reaction buffer to room temperature.\n\n\n3.\nPrepare dilution buffer (150\u00a0\u03bcL/sample) with water.\n\n\n4.\nDilute 50\u00a0\u03bcL of cell culture supernatant with 150\u00a0\u03bcL of dilution buffer (this is adequate to test the sample in triplicate).\n\n\n5.\nHeat at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, and then cool on ice to room temperature. To avoid high background levels, do not add the assay buffer to warm/hot culture media.\n\n\n6.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL of cooled sample (triplicates of each time point sample) to the white 96-well plates.\n\n\n7.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL of assay buffer; incubate for 5\u00a0min.\n\n\n8.\nDilute sufficient CSPD\u00ae substrate 1:20 with the diluent to make the reaction buffer (50\u00a0\u03bcL/well).\n\n\n9.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL of reaction buffer; incubate for 20\u00a0min.\n\n\n10.\nMeasure the luciferase activity in the luminometer for 0.1\u20131\u00a0s/well. The entire plate can be measured at once. For the positive control and standard curve, use the stock enzyme supplied with the kit. The stock enzyme is supplied at approximately 3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (0.75\u00a0U/mL). Generate a standard curve by serially diluting the stock enzyme in dilution buffer or cell culture media. A 10\u00a0\u03bcL aliquot of the stock enzyme can be used for the upper end of the dynamic range. For the negative control, use cell extract from the negative control cells.\n\n\n11.\nMeasure samples for secreted Gluc activity at each time post transfection.\n\n\n12.\nMeasure samples for SEAP activity 12\u00a0h post transfection. The SEAP assay is performed in triplicate for each sample. To calculate the final SEAP value per sample, take the average of the three values. The SEAP values is used for normalization.\n\n\n13.\nTo analyze the Gluc data, first subtract counts per second (CPS) from the background controls from the CPS for each sample (measured intensity in CPS may vary among luminometers). Divide that result by the average SEAP value for that well and multiply by a factor of 1000.\n\n\n14.\nGraph the results for statistical analysis.\n\n\n4 Notes\n\n\n1.\nOther ambisense/bidirectional plasmids, such as pDZ [11] or pHW2000 [15], can be used for RG of IAVs with appropriate amplification primers.\n\n\n2.\nThe HEK293T and MDCK cells are also available from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, BEI Resources NR-9313 (HEK293T) and NR-2628 (MDCK), or from the Influenza Reagent Resource, IRR: FR-241 (HEK293T) and FR-242 (MDCK). It is important to keep track of cell passage number, particularly for MDCK cells, since it affects the growth of IAVs. The use of late passage cells (above passage 50) is not recommended.\n\n\n3.\nTissue culture media, supplies, transfection reagents, PCR reagents, and luciferase activity kits are available through different vendors. Some options that have provided optimal results in our hands are listed. Regarding RT reagents, synthesis of cDNA can be performed using other reverse transcriptases following manufacturer\u2019s directions. Substitution of different kits may require some optimization, but following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions should be attempted first.\n\n\n4.\nTo obtain the pGluc-NS vector or pCMV-SEAP vector, contact authors. The pCMV-SEAP vector may be available commercially or from other laboratories.\n\n\n5.\nOther available RNA extraction reagents and methods can be used following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) is preferred when high titer or high concentration of virus is not available.\n\n\n6.\nPrimers can be modified based on specific needs. In IAVs, the first 12 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end and last 13 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end of each vRNA segment are highly conserved and the basis for the design of universal (Uni) primers [18\u201320]. Bm-NA 1F and Bm-NA 1413R will amplify NA segments from N1, N2, N4, N5, and N8 subtypes. Also, while cloning adapters are described with BsmBI restriction sites, BsaI, AarI, or BbsI restriction sites may be used. Restriction sites should be selected to avoid internal digestion of the segment.\n\n\n7.\nLarger viral segments (e.g., PB2, PB1, and PA) are more difficult to amplify because of their length (>2\u00a0kb). Consider using more cDNA as a template during the PCR reaction. Alternatively, performing PCR amplification of overlapping fragments of smaller size followed by a second PCR to yield on full-length fragment yields satisfactory results.\n\n\n8.\nOther E. coli competent cells prepared by chemical methods or electroporation can be used for plasmid transformation. LB liquid media, SOC liquid media, LB agar plates, and ampicillin 1000\u00d7 can be purchased from commercial vendors ready to use or can be prepared in-house.\n\n\n9.\nIt is not uncommon to find PCR fragments that are difficult to clone into any of the RG vectors. A combination of inefficient restriction enzyme digestion and other inherent properties of the PCR product may in part explain such failures. If that is the case, consider other PCR cloning shuttle vectors and proceed with subcloning into the bidirectional rescue plasmid after a suitable insert template has been obtained. For cloning unstable inserts, consider the use of other E. coli strains for improved stability. Alternatively, decreasing temperature (e.g., 30\u00a0\u00b0C) helps with the cloning of unstable inserts into the ambisense rescue plasmids.\n\n\n10.\nThere are four options for picking colonies which will retain some bacteria for growth once positive clones are identified:\n\n(a)\nDirectly pipet the colony into the PCR master mix.\n\n\n(b)\nPipet into a 1.5\u00a0mL tube containing 10\u00a0\u03bcL LB/Amp, mix by pipetting up and down, and then use ~0.2\u00a0\u03bcL for PCR. The excess material can be stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C until the PCR results are available, so if the colony is positive, it can be used to grow the clones.\n\n\n(c)\nShake the pipet tip with the colony on it (do not pipet up or down) into a 50\u00a0mL centrifuge tube containing 4\u20135\u00a0mL LB/Amp, which will be used to directly grow any positive clones (store at 4\u00a0\u00b0C until use). For the PCR template, use what remains on the tip for the PCR template by pipetting up and down into a tube containing the PCR master mix.\n\n\n(d)\nInoculate the colony onto another LB/Amp plate (place a grid underneath to help identify the location of the positive clones). Similar to option 3, use what remains attached on the pipet as the PCR template by pipetting up and down into a tube containing the PCR master mix. Incubate the LB/Amp plate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C to let colonies grow again.\n\n\n\n\n11.\nColonies can also be screened by isolating the plasmid with a DNA mini-prep and then restriction digestion. A virtual plasmid map of the expected clone, if sequences are known, facilitates the interpretation of screening methods. Regardless of the screening method, positive clones must be sequenced in order to rule out the presence of spurious mutations in either the influenza gene segment or plasmid vector (particularly on promoter regions).\n\n\n12.\nDigestion of pDP2002 with BsmBI does not leave compatible ends for self-ligation. However, carryover vector digested at a single site may lead to background colonies in the absence of inserts. Consider the use of alkaline phosphatases that catalyze the dephosphorylation of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of DNA (e.g., heat-labile Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase) in order to reduce background. We recommend the use of positive (digested plasmid vector plus a well-characterized cloning fragment) and negative control ligation reactions (digested plasmid vector without PCR fragment), in order to determine background colony levels. A\u00a0\u2265\u00a010:1 positive to background ratio is expected under normal conditions.\n\n\n13.\nHigh-quality plasmid preparations devoid of protein and other impurities are critical for successful rescue of IAVs generated by RG. Measure DNA and RNA concentrations at an absorbance of 260\u00a0nm using a spectrophotometer. The 260:280 ratio is used to estimate sample purity. A plasmid preparation with a 260:280\u00a0nm ratio of \u22651.8 is highly recommended. Other ligation methods can be used following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\n14.\nHEK293T cells may detach in the presence of TPCK-trypsin and absence of serum. This is not indicative of virus rescue.\n\n\n15.\nWhile procedures for analysis and characterization of influenza A and B viruses are the same, these viruses have distinct optimal growth temperatures. In tissue culture, IAVs grow at 35\u201337\u00a0\u00b0C and influenza B viruses replicate ideally at 33\u201335\u00a0\u00b0C. In ECE, the recommended temperature for growth of IAVs is 35\u00a0\u00b0C, while influenza B viruses are grown at 33\u00a0\u00b0C."}
{"text": "Establishment of a Reverse Genetics System for Influenza D Virus. \n ABSTRACT \n Influenza D virus (IDV) was initially isolated in the United States in 2011. IDV is distributed worldwide and is one of the causative agents of the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), which causes high morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. The molecular mechanisms of IDV pathogenicity are still unknown. Reverse genetics systems are vital tools not only for studying the biology of viruses, but also for use in applications such as recombinant vaccine viruses. Here, we report the establishment of a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for IDV. We first verified that the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide of each 7-segmented genomic RNA contained uracil (U), contrary to previous reports, and we were then able to successfully generate recombinant IDV by cotransfecting 7 plasmids containing these genomic RNAs along with 4 plasmids expressing polymerase proteins and nucleoprotein into human rectal tumor 18G (HRT-18G) cells. The recombinant virus had a growth deficit compared to the wild-type virus, and we determined the reason for this growth difference by examining the genomic RNA content of the viral particles. We found that the recombinant virus incorporated an unbalanced ratio of viral RNA segments into particles compared to that of the wild-type virus, and thus we adjusted the amount of each plasmid used in transfection to obtain a recombinant virus with the same replicative capacity as the wild-type virus. Our work here in establishing a reverse genetics system for IDV will have a broad range of applications, including uses in studies focused on better understanding IDV replication and pathogenicity, as well as in those contributing to the development of BRDC countermeasures.IMPORTANCE The bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) causes high mortality and morbidity in cattle, causing economic losses worldwide. Influenza D virus (IDV) is considered to be a causative agent of the BRDC. Here, we developed a reverse genetics system that allows for the generation of IDV from cloned cDNAs and the introduction of mutations into the IDV genome. This reverse genetics system will become a powerful tool for use in studies related to understanding the molecular mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenicity and will also lead to the development of new countermeasures against the BRDC.INTRODUCTIONInfluenza D virus (IDV), a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae, was first isolated from pigs with respiratory illness in Oklahoma, USA, in 2011 (1, 2). Epidemiological analyses revealed, based on their high seroprevalence for IDV, that cattle are the main host of the virus (2, 3). Further epidemiological studies revealed that IDVs circulate in cattle in many countries, including the United States (2\u20134), Mexico (5), China (6), Japan (7, 8), France (9), Italy (10), Ireland (11), Luxembourg (12), and African countries (13). Furthermore, serological studies showed that IDV antibodies are found in pigs (14), sheep (15, 16), goats (15, 16), dromedary camels (13, 17), horses (18), and humans (19). These findings imply that IDVs are globally distributed in several animal hosts.IDV is one of the causative agents of the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) (5, 20). The BRDC causes high morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle, and over 40% of cattle death in the United States is due to the BRDC, which causes severe economic losses (21). To control the BRDC, combined vaccines consisting of several known causative viral (and bacterial) agents have been employed, but their efficacies are limited (21\u201323). One possible reason for this reduced efficacy is that the vaccines did not contain all causative agents of the BRDC. Recent metagenomic analyses indicate that IDVs are found in cattle with BRDC (5). Therefore, addition of IDV to vaccines may help to control the BRDC.Influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV, respectively) possess 8-segmented negative-sense RNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, hemagglutinin [HA], nucleoprotein [NP], NA, M, and NS) as genomes, whereas influenza C virus (ICV) and IDV possess 7-segmented segments (PB2, PB1, P3, HEF, NP, M, and NS) as genomes. The viral RNA (vRNA) of influenza virus forms the ribonucleoprotein complex together with three polymerase subunits, PB2, PB1, and PA/P3, in addition to NP. The HEF of IDV is a spike protein on the viral envelope that binds the cell surface via terminal 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (24), which is also known to be a receptor of ICV (25), while the M2 protein of IDV acts as an ion channel protein (26). Although the functions of the M1, NS1, and NS2 proteins of IDV are unknown, we speculate that their functions are similar to those of the ICV counterparts (27\u201330).Reverse genetics systems are vital tools not only for studying the biology of viruses but also for use in applications such as recombinant vaccine viruses. While reverse genetics systems for IAV (31\u201333), IBV (34, 35), and ICV (28, 36) exist, a reverse genetics system for IDV has not been established yet. Such a system could aid in understanding the molecular properties of IDV, in addition to improving methods of disease control. In reverse genetics systems for IAV, IBV, or ICV, RNA polymerase I (PolI) promoter and terminator were used to construct plasmids expressing viral RNAs. These plasmids were cotransfected with plasmids expressing viral-polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1, and PA/P3) and NP into cells, and recombinant viruses were rescued from the supernatants of transfected cells (28, 32, 33, 35, 36). Other systems have also been developed for IAV. These used RNA polymerase I and II transcriptional units, allowing the generation of both vRNA and mRNA from one viral cDNA template (32), or used vRNA transcription with ribozyme-mediated generation of the exact ends of the segments (37). Here, we established a plasmid-based reverse genetics system with IDV using the RNA PolI system, which is similar to that used in reverse genetics systems for other influenza-type viruses.RESULTSDetermination of the 3\u2032-terminal sequences of genomic RNA segments of IDV.All influenza viruses possess complementary sequences between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal regions of each genome segment. The 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides of each segment are adenine (A) and uracil (U), respectively, which are conserved in IAV, IBV, and ICV. However, a previous study reported that, although the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides of the HEF, M, and NS segments of the IDV genome are U, those of the PB2, PB1, P3, and NP segments are cytosine (C), which is not complementary to the A of 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides (1). To confirm these previous findings, we reassessed 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-terminal sequence regions of each segment of D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) through the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. Our results confirmed that the 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides of every segment of IDV were A (Fig. 1A). However, we found that 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides of all segments were U in our D/OK stock, in contrast to those in a previous report (1) (Fig. 1B). We next determined 3\u2032-terminal sequences of genome segments from 10 plaque-cloned D/OK stocks and two other IDV stocks of D/bovine/Yamagata/10710/2016 and D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 and found that segments from all IDVs tested contained U. These data verify that the 3\u2032-terminal sequence of each IDV segment is U, as is seen for other influenza viruses.FIG 1FIG 1 Sequences of 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal regions of viral RNA segments of influenza D virus. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method was performed with D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK). (A) Genomic RNA sequences at 5\u2032-terminal regions of RNA segments of D/OK are shown, in which each number indicates the nucleotide position from the 5\u2032 end. (B) Genomic RNA sequences at 3\u2032-terminal regions of RNA segments of D/OK are shown, in which each number indicates the nucleotide position from the 3\u2032 end.Generation of recombinant D/OK virus by reverse genetics.Prior to development of a reverse genetics system for IDV, we characterized the D/OK-clone, which was obtained by biological cloning through plaque purification. The growth kinetics and plaque phenotype of the clone were similar to those of the original D/OK stock (Fig. 2). Genome sequences of the D/OK-clone showed two synonymous substitutions in the PB2 and P3 segments and one nonsynonymous substitution (Ala to Thr) at amino acid position 204 of PB2, compared to D/OK sequences deposited in the NCBI database (Table 1).FIG 2FIG 2 Growth properties of cloned D/OK. (A) Growth kinetics of cloned D/OK (D/OK-clone) were examined in swine testis (ST) cells. D/OK-clone and original D/OK were inoculated onto cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Virus titers were determined at 12-h intervals postinfection by plaque assay and reported as the mean titer with standard deviations (n\u2009=\u20093). (B) Representative plaque morphology of D/OK-clone in ST cells is shown. The plaques were immunologically stained with mouse anti-D/OK polyclonal antibody.TABLE 1TABLE 1 Sequence differences observed between D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 and its plaque-purified virusSegmentAmino acid positionAmino acid in strain:Nucleotide sequence in strain:D/OKaD/OK-clonebD/oKD/OK-clonePB2204AlaThrGCAACA601AlaAlaGCGGCAP3520ValValGTCGTTaD/OK, wild-type D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011.bD/OK-clone, a single clone obtained by three consecutive plaque purifications of D/OK on ST cells.We cloned cDNAs of 7 vRNA segments of the D/OK-clone into a plasmid for vRNA synthesis (referred to as pPolI-D/OK-PB2, pPolI-D/OK-PB1, pPolI-D/OK-P3, pPolI-D/OK-HEF, pPolI-D/OK-NP, pPolI-D/OK-M, and pPolI-D/OK-NS, respectively) and generated 4 plasmids for vRNA synthesis of PB2, PB1, P3, and NP that possessed C at their 3\u2032 terminal nucleotides (referred to as pPolI-D/OK-PB2/C, pPolI-D/OK-PB1/C, pPolI-D/OK-P3/C, and pPolI-D/OK-NP/C). We additionally prepared 4 plasmids expressing the PB2, PB1, P3, and NP proteins of D/OK (referred to as pCAGGS-PB2, pCAGGS-PB1, pCAGGS-P3, and pCAGGS-NP). We used two sets of vRNA expression plasmids for reverse genetics; one set consisted of pPolI-D/OK-PB2, -PB1, -P3, -HEF, -NP, -M, and -NS, and the other set consisted of pPolI-D/OK-PB2/C, -PB1/C, -P3/C, -HEF, -NP/C, -M, and -NS. We then transfected human rectal tumor 18G (HRT-18G) cells with 0.2\u2009\u03bcg of each plasmid from each set and 4 protein expression plasmids, pCAGGS-PB2, -PB1, -P3, and -NP. After incubation for 5\u2009days, the supernatant was transferred to fresh swine testis (ST) cells and incubated for 2 to 3 additional days. Virus rescue was checked by assessing the cytopathic effect (CPE) and performing a hemagglutination test, as well as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). We successfully rescued a virus (OK-RG) with the first set of plasmids but not with the second set, and we verified that the OK-RG sequence had no mutations in the genome, including in the 3\u2032 terminal nucleotides of all segments. There was no amplification by a control PCR without reverse transcriptase of any sequences from the supernatants containing the rescued virus (Fig. 3A and B) and thus no carryover of the plasmids for transfection. These data demonstrated the successful generation of recombinant D/OK virus through reverse genetics, but only for instances where the 3\u2032 terminal sequences of vRNAs contained U.FIG 3FIG 3 Characterization of recombinant D/OK. RNA was extracted from the culture supernatant of ST cells inoculated with the transfectant. RT-PCR protocol was performed with primers speci\ufb01c for (A) the full length or (B) a partial length of each segment with (+) or without (\u2212) reverse transcriptase (RT). The amplified products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. (C) Growth kinetics of recombinant D/OK (OK-RG) generated by reverse genetics were examined in ST cells. OK-RG and D/OK-clone were inoculated onto cells at an MOI of 0.01. Virus titers were determined at 12-h intervals postinfection by plaque assay and reported as the mean titer with standard deviations (n\u2009=\u20093). Representative plaque morphologies of OK-RG (D), passaged OK-RGs (P1 to P6) and regenerated virus of the 6th passaged virus by reverse genetics (rP6) (E), and plaque-purified OK-RG clones (1\u20133) in ST cells (F) were used for comparison to the other plaque morphologies in each panel. The plaques were immunologically stained with mouse anti-D/OK polyclonal antibody.We next compared growth kinetics of the D/OK-clone and the OK-RG virus in ST cells (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, viral titers of OK-RG were 3 to 4 log lower than those of the D/OK-clone, even though the genome sequences of both viruses were identical. Plaque size for the OK-RG virus was smaller than that for the D/OK-clone (Fig. 3D). OK-RG passaged at a low multiplicity of infection exhibited large plaques after the 6th passage (Fig. 3E). This passaged virus with large plaques contained a PB2-M55I mutation; however, the recombinant virus rP6 containing this mutation generated by reverse genetics again formed small plaques. In another experimental trial, we purified the virus with small plaques by plaque picking but could not obtain the virus with large plaques (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these findings suggest the presence of an unknown factor contributing to the inhibition of virus growth in the rescued OK-RG preparation.Verification of genomic RNA content packing in OK-RG particles.To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the OK-RG growth deficit, we first confirmed vRNA expression in the plasmid-transfected cells. We extracted intracellular vRNAs from the cells and examined content of each RNA segment by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A). vRNA expression varied between segments even though equal amounts of each plasmid were used for transfection, whereas similar amounts of each vRNAs were detected in D/OK-clone-infected cells.FIG 4FIG 4 vRNAs in plasmid-transfected cells and in OK-RG particles. (A) Intracellular vRNAs extracted from plasmid-transfected HRT-18G cells at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h posttransfection were examined by Northern blot analysis with segment-specific riboprobes. vRNAs extracted from D/OK-clone-infected cells at 48 h postinfection (p.i.) were also examined. (B) RNAs extracted from the purified D/OK-clone, OK-RG, OK-RG2, OK-RG3, and plaque-purified OK-RG (OK-RG/14p) were subjected to Northern blot analysis with segment-specific and 18S rRNA-specific riboprobes. (C) Genomic RNAs extracted from the purified D/OK-clone, OK-RG, and OK-RG/14p were subjected to urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each RNA was run on a 4% urea-polyacrylamide gel for 10 h at 20\u2009mA. The gel was stained with SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain.We next examined and compared vRNA content packaged into the D/OK-clone and OK-RGs, including two additional recombinant OK-RG-2 and OK-RG-3 viruses, which had been rescued independently, by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, levels of PB2, P3, and NP RNAs were lower in sucrose gradient-purified OK-RG particles than in purified D/OK-clone particles, whereas levels of HEF, M, and NS RNAs were slightly lower in OK-RG particles than in D/OK-clone particles. Levels of PB1 RNA were comparable between OK-RG and D/OK-clone particles. These results suggest that vRNA content packaged into OK-RG particles does not reflect vRNA content in the transfected cells.In our previous report, 7-segmented (hemagglutinin [HA] segment-deficient) IAV incorporated ribosomal RNAs into its virion (38). Thus, we examined the presence of 18S rRNA in purified recombinant virus, and we found a greater amount of 18S rRNAs in OK-RG particles compared to that in D/OK-clone particles (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that OK-RG disproportionally incorporates genomic RNA segments, as well as rRNA, into viral particles. This result suggests that a considerable number of noninfectious particles, such as defective interference particles, are generated in the supernatant through reverse genetics procedures, which may lead to the growth deficit of OK-RG compared to the D/OK-clone.To confirm this hypothesis, we directly examined the content of RNA segments packaged into viral particles. We extracted vRNAs from purified OK-RG and separated them through urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), which revealed different profiles of RNA segments for the D/OK-clone and OK-RG (Fig. 4C). P3 and NP RNA levels were substantially lower in OK-RG than in the D/OK-clone, and abundant 18S rRNA, whose band likely covered that of HEF, was detected in OK-RG through Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4B). We found a few extra bands between HEF and NP and between NP and M, suggesting the presence of undefined, deleted forms of RNA segments that were not detected through Northern blot analysis. These data also suggest that OK-RG disproportionally incorporates genomic RNA segments during particle formation.Optimization of the reverse genetics system.Based on our Northern blot (Fig. 4B) and urea-PAGE (Fig. 4C) analyses, we reconsidered transfection conditions for reverse genetics in order to package similar amounts of each RNA segment into viral particles. We tested an additional 17 transfection conditions by increasing and/or decreasing each vRNA- or protein-expressing plasmid (Table 2). Although viruses were rescued under all conditions, most plaque sizes were smaller than those of the D/OK-clone (Fig. 5A). However, viruses rescued under condition 14 (OK-RG/14) included a high population of those forming large plaques (Fig. 5A). We then plaque isolated this virus and propagated it once in ST cells (referred to as OK-RG/14p). When growth kinetics of OK-RG/14 and OK-RG/14p were tested in ST cells (Fig. 5B), we found that OK-RG/14p grew to a titer similar to that of the D/OK-clone, which was approximately 10-fold higher than that of OK-RG/14, suggesting that OK-RG/14p possessed a similar infectivity to that of wild-type D/OK. In addition, we confirmed that the entire genome sequence of OK-RG/14p was identical to that of the D/OK-clone. To rule out crosscontamination with the parent virus and to confirm the optimality for transfection condition 14, we produced a virus with an artificial, synonymous mutation by creating a new EcoRI recognition sequence in the HEF segment using reverse genetics. We rescued transfectant viruses (OK-EcoRI-RGs) under the several selected conditions (conditions 12 to 17), resulting in a large population of those forming large plaques under condition 14 (Fig. 5C) possessing an EcoRI recognition site in the HEF segment (Fig. 5D).TABLE 2TABLE 2 Transfection conditions used for reverse geneticsPlasmid functionSegmentAmt of plasmid (\u03bcg) under condition:Original1234567891011121314151617Protein expressionPB20.20.10.10.10.10.10.10.20.20.20.20.21.01.01.01.01.01.0PB10.20.10.10.10.10.10.10.20.20.20.20.21.01.01.01.01.01.0P30.20.10.10.10.10.10.10.20.20.20.20.21.01.01.01.01.01.0NP0.20.10.10.10.10.10.10.20.20.20.20.21.01.01.01.01.01.0vRNA synthesisPB20.20.21.00.60.20.20.51.00.60.20.20.50.21.00.60.20.20.5PB10.20.20.10.10.10.020.020.10.10.10.020.020.20.10.10.10.020.02P30.20.21.00.60.20.20.51.00.60.20.20.50.21.00.60.20.20.5HEF0.20.20.10.10.10.020.10.10.10.10.020.10.20.10.10.10.020.1NP0.20.21.00.60.20.20.51.00.60.20.20.50.21.00.60.20.20.5M0.20.20.10.10.10.020.10.10.10.10.020.10.20.10.10.10.020.1NS0.20.20.10.10.10.020.10.10.10.10.020.10.20.10.10.10.020.1FIG 5FIG 5 Growth properties of recombinant viruses generated under different conditions in reverse genetics. (A) Representative plaque morphologies in ST cells of the viruses rescued under both original and 17 different conditions (shown in Table 2), as well as that of the D/OK-clone, are shown. The plaques were immunologically stained with mouse anti-D/OK polyclonal antibody. (B) Growth kinetics of recombinant OK-RG/14 and plaque-purified OK-RG/14p generated under transfection condition 14 were examined. OK-RG/14, OK-RG/14p, OK-RG, and the D/OK-clone were inoculated onto ST cells at an MOI of 0.01. Virus titers were determined at 12-h intervals postinfection by plaque assay and reported as the mean titer with standard deviation (n\u2009=\u20093). (C) Representative plaque morphologies of D/OK-EcoRI-RGs under transfection conditions 12 to 17 (as shown in Table 2) in ST cells. Three independent experiments (no. 1 to 3) were performed for the generation of D/OK-EcoRI-RG. (D) The HEF gene of D/OK-RG, D/OK-EcoRI-RG/14p, or D/OK-clone was amplified by RT-PCR with primers that yielded a full-length 2,049-bp fragment, followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The presence of EcoRI sites in the PCR products yielded both 1,307- and 738-bp fragments.We next assessed the content of RNA segments packaged into purified OK-RG/14p particles. In a Northern blot analysis, the RNA segment content of OK-RG/14p was similar to that of the D/OK-clone, and 18S rRNA was not detected in OK-RG/14p particles (Fig. 4B). In a urea-PAGE analysis, the profiles of RNA segments were similar between D/OK-clone and OK-RG/14p, except for a greater amount of PB2 and/or PB1 RNA packaging in OK-RG/14p particles (Fig. 4C). No RNA content was detected in the control material prepared from mock-infected cells using the same procedures. These results suggest that a well-balanced packaging of RNA segments can be achieved under transfection condition 14, leading to similar growth properties for OK-RG/14p and the D/OK-clone.DISCUSSIONReverse genetics systems, which are used to generate recombinant viruses, are vital tools not only to study the biology of influenza viruses but also for developing antiviral strategies such as the generation of recombinant vaccine viruses. Here, we established a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for IDV.For previously published reverse genetics systems with IAV, IBV, and ICV, human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were mainly used for virus rescue due to their high transfection efficiency and the presence of T antigen required for replication of pCAGGS-based vectors (28, 32, 33, 35, 36). In this study, we first tested this cell line for potential use in an IDV reverse genetics system. Although recombinant D/OKs were rescued after several attempts, their infectivities (PFU titers) were low, despite high hemagglutination titers in the supernatant of transfected cells. Their plaque sizes were also small, suggesting the presence of abundant noninfectious particles. Therefore, we next tested HRT-18G cells, which have been widely used for IDV isolation, in our IDV reverse genetics system. Although this cell line showed a much lower transfection efficiency than that of HEK293T cells, recombinant D/OKs with high infectivity were rescued, as revealed by higher PFU/HA ratios than those seen with HEK293T cells. These findings imply that support of viral replication is a more important factor to consider than transfection efficiency when choosing cells for use in an IDV reverse genetics system. Therefore, a possible system in which the bovine (or swine) PolI vector is utilized as a vRNA synthetic plasmid for transfection in bovine (or swine) cells may enhance the rescue efficiency of recombinant IDVs.IAV, IBV, and ICV contain adenine (A) and uracil (U) at the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal ends, respectively, of every RNA segment, and complementary sequences of both terminal regions, including these two nucleotides, form panhandle structures of viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP), as well as transcription/replication promoter structures for the viral genome in IAV. Here, we found that all RNA segments of IDV also possess U at their 3\u2032-terminal ends, in contrast to a previous report showing that PB2, PB1, P3, and NP RNAs of D/OK possessed cytosine (C) (1). Although we were not able to rescue recombinant D/OK with RNA segments possessing C at the 3\u2032-terminal ends, this does not eliminate the possibility that the original D/OK may possess C at the 3\u2032-terminal ends of these RNA segments. However, it is likely that viral passages in the laboratory would result in the selection of D/OK with U at the 3\u2032-terminal ends of all RNA segments. Alternatively, C at the 3\u2032-terminal end may be incorrectly read due to an undefined artifact resulting from the RACE method (1). Further sequence analyses of the 3\u2032-terminal ends of RNA segments in other multiple-IDV isolates will clarify this point.In this study, we successfully established a reverse genetics system for IDV by fine adjustment of quantitative transfection conditions for viral RNA synthetic and protein expression plasmids. This adjustment resulted in the balanced packaging of 7 RNA segments in viral particles, leading to the rescue of recombinant D/OK, with growth properties similar to the D/OK-clone. Interestingly, unlike in reverse genetics with IAV, such recombinant D/OK viruses have not been selected in other methodological trials such as high-dilution passages or plaque picking of the rescued viruses with low infectivity, suggesting that noninfectious interfering particles would be consecutively cosegregated once the imbalanced contents of genome segments in the infected cells are maintained. This would lead to a small-plaque phenotype, even though whole-genome sequences are identical to that of the original D/OK-clone with a large-plaque phenotype. This finding suggests an intrinsically different mechanism for genome packaging between IAV and IDV. Two models for genome packaging of influenza virions have been proposed, random and selective packaging (39). Previous studies support the hypothesis that IAV most likely contains a selective packaging mechanism (39\u201342). IAV and IBV incorporate eight RNPs arranged in a specific \u201c1\u2009+\u20097\u201d pattern, in which seven RNPs surround a central RNP (40, 43, 44). Surprisingly, artificially generated 7-segmented IAV, which lacks an HA segment, incorporated rRNA as the eighth RNP instead of an HA segment (38). Interestingly, ICV and IDV both possess a 7-segmented genome, yet also incorporated 8 RNPs, although the inclusion of rRNA in virions was not assessed (45). These findings imply that all influenza viruses may incorporate 8 RNPs, suggesting the presence of an undefined random packaging mechanism in addition to a selective packaging one, especially for ICV and IDV. Several studies also support the interpretation that the genome packaging mechanisms of IAV and ICV are different. In one study, artificially generated virus-like particles (VLPs) of IAV with fewer than 8 RNA segments were less efficiently produced than those with one complete set of 8 RNA segments (46, 47), whereas in a different study, VLPs of ICV with single RNA segments were produced more efficiently than those with a complete set of 7 RNA segments (27, 48). Our present study also supports such a difference, in which OK-RG incorporated unbalanced ratios of RNA segments and rRNA into particles when equal amounts of plasmids were used for transfection. This imbalance may have resulted in the generation of abundant noninfectious particles in the supernatant of transfected cells, which may have interfered with virion production. However, this transfection condition is regularly used for reverse genetics with IAV, suggesting a difference in genome packaging between IAV and IDV. Further studies are required to elucidate differences in the genome packaging mechanism between 8-segmented and 7-segmented viruses.While our article was pending review for publication, another research group reported development of a reverse genetics system for IDV (49). They used an alternative system, in which seven plasmids with RNA PolI-PolII transcription units were used for transfection to rescue the virus, and also used a different strain, D/swine/Oklahoma/1314/2011, from the strain used in our study. Notably, this strain seems to originally possess U at the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide of all 7 RNA segments, according to the reported primer sequences for cDNA amplification, being the same sequence as the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide of PB2, PB1, PA, and NP segments of our strain. However, their strain grew to a lower titer than that of our strain in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Our strain grew to a titer of 108 PFU/ml in this cell line, which was over 100 times higher than the titer of their strain. We are planning to develop a similar PolI-PolII-based system with our strain and to compare it with our PolI-based system in the context of accuracy and utility for generation of IDVs.In conclusion, this study established a PolI-based reverse genetics system for IDV. However, transfection procedures must be carefully observed, since we determined that only one transfection condition (condition 14) can efficiently generate virions with original infectivity. Nonetheless, this system will allow us to produce recombinant viruses with viable mutation(s) in the IDV genome and will aid in the study of molecular mechanisms of virus replication, including genome packaging and pathogenicity. Based on such knowledge, we will be able to generate live attenuated IDVs, which could be an effective control measure against the BRDC.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and viruses.Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (obtained from Riken BRC, RCB2202), human rectal tumor 18G (HRT-18G) cells (CRL-11663; obtained from ATCC), and swine testis (ST) cells (CRL-1746; obtained from ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C. D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) (GenBank accession no. JQ922305 to JQ922311) (1) and D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 (accession no. KM392468 to KM392474) (4) were kindly provided by B. Hause (Kansas State University). Our isolate of D/bovine/Yamagata/10710/2016 (accession no. LC318665to LC318671) (45) was also used. These IDVs were propagated in ST cells in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM; Life Technologies/Gibco, Paisley, UK) containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (MEM/BSA) and supplemented with 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylmethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and stocked at \u221280\u00b0C.Construction of plasmids for reverse genetics.RNA was extracted from culture supernatant of plaque-cloned D/OK (D/OK-clone)-infected ST cells using Isogen-LS reagent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan), and the cDNAs were amplified by PCR using KOD FX Neo (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and a set of segment-specific primers containing 15-nucleotide-overlapped sequences to the cloning site of the pHH21 plasmid, which contains human RNA polymerase I (PolI) promoter and murine PolI terminator sequences (33). The PCR products were purified with a FastGene gel/PCR extraction kit (Nippon Genetics, Tokyo, Japan) and cloned into BsmBI-digested pHH21 using a Gibson assembly master mix (New England BioLabs [NEB] Japan, Tokyo, Japan), resulting in pPolI-D/OK-PB2, -PB1, -P3, -HEF, -NP, -M, and -NS plasmids. pPolI-D/OK-PB2/C, -PB1/C, -P3/C, and -NP/C plasmids possessing C at the 3\u2032-terminal ends of viral RNAs were also generated using a set of segment-specific primers containing C at the 3\u2032-terminal end, and 15-nucleotide-overlapped sequences to the cloning site of pHH21. Coding regions of PB2, PB1, P3, and NP segments were PCR amplified using KOD FX Neo and 15-nucleotide-overlapped sequences to the cloning site of pCAGGS plasmid (50). The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pCAGGS using a Gibson assembly master mix, resulting in pCAGGS-D/OK-PB2, -PB1, -P3, and -NP plasmids.Generation of recombinant IDV by reverse genetics.Sixty-percent-confluent HRT-18G cells, seeded on a 6-well plate, were transfected with 7 viral RNA-synthetic plasmids and 4 protein (PB2, PB1, P3, and NP) expression plasmids using 0.2\u2009\u03bcg of each plasmid with 11\u2009\u03bcl of 1\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcl PEI Max (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Prior to transfection, the plasmid DNAs and transfection reagent were mixed and incubated at 23\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. The mixtures were then added to the cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. At 2\u2009days posttransfection, the supernatants were removed, and cells were washed twice with MEM before the addition of 2\u2009ml of MEM/BSA containing 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin. After 3\u2009days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the supernatants were collected, diluted 10-fold with MEM/BSA, and inoculated on ST cells for 1 h. The cells were washed twice in MEM before the addition of 2\u2009ml of MEM/BSA containing 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin, and then incubated at 37\u00b0C. At 2 to 3\u2009days postinfection, supernatants were collected, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay in ST cells. The supernatant stock was directly utilized as single-passage viruses for each experiment to characterize growth properties of the viruses. In addition, second-passage viruses in ST cells were used for virus purification for urea-PAGE and Northern blot analyses.Plaque assay.Confluent ST cells on a 12-well plate were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), inoculated with 0.1\u2009ml each of serially 10-fold diluted viruses in MEM/BSA, and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Cell were then washed with MEM/BSA, covered with 1\u2009ml of MEM/BSA containing 1% Seakem GTG agarose (Lonza Japan, Chiba, Japan) and 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3\u2009days. One-half\u2009ml of 30% formalin in PBS was added to each well for fixation at 4\u00b0C overnight. After formalin and agarose were removed, the cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15\u2009min at 23\u00b0C. After blocking with Block Ace (KAC, Hyogo, Japan), the cells were incubated with anti-IDV mouse immune serum as a primary antibody for 60\u2009min, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody (catalog no. B7264; Sigma, Kanagawa, Japan) for 30\u2009min, followed by a complex containing 4\u2009\u03bcg/ml biotinylated peroxidase (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) and 8\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptavidin (Fujifilm Wako Chemicals) for 30\u2009min. The plaques were visualized by the DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.Hemagglutination assay.A hemagglutination assay was performed in U-bottom 96-well microplates as previously described (51). Briefly, serial 2-fold dilutions of the supernatants in 50 \u03bcl of PBS were mixed with 50 \u03bcl of 0.7% turkey red blood cells and incubated for 30\u2009min at 23\u00b0C before reading. The hemagglutination titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest virus dilution showing complete hemagglutination.5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RACE.5\u2032 and 3\u2032 rapid amplification of the cDNA end (RACE) was performed using a 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (2nd generation; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with some modifications. Briefly, viral RNAs were extracted from purified virus particles using Isogen-LS. For 5\u2032 RACE, the extracted RNAs were reverse transcribed using segment-specific primers. The cDNA products were then added along with poly(dA) using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Roche). The cDNAs with added poly(dA) were amplified by segment-specific primers and our oligo-(dT) primer containing a synthetic tag (5\u2032-GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3\u2032) [instead of the oligo(dT)-anchor primer 5\u2032-GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV-3\u2032] provided by the kit), followed by seminested-PCR using segment-specific primers and PCR anchor primer (5\u2032-GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGAC-3\u2032). For 3\u2032 RACE, a poly(A) tail was added to the viral RNAs using Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase (NEB). The RNAs with added poly(A) were reverse transcribed using the oligo(dT) primer with added tag, and the cDNAs were amplified by PCR using PCR anchor primer and segment-specific primers. The PCR products were sequenced using a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies Japan/Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). The sequences of the segment-specific primers will be provided upon request.Virus purification.The virus-containing supernatants from ST cells were clari\ufb01ed by low-speed centrifugation to remove cell debris and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 40,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 2 h at 4\u00b0C using a P19A rotor (Himac, Tokyo, Japan). The concentrated viruses were resuspended in PBS and layered onto a 20, 30, 50, and 60% discontinuous sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged at 110,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 3 h at 4\u00b0C using a P32ST rotor (Himac). The virus-containing interface between the 30 and 50% sucrose gradient was collected, diluted in PBS, and ultracentrifuged once more at 110,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 3 h at 4\u00b0C using a P32ST rotor. Purified virus pellets were suspended in a small amount of PBS.Urea-PAGE.RNAs of the purified viruses were extracted using an miRNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). To separate RNA segments, urea-PAGE was used as previously described (45), with some modifications. viral RNA (100 ng) was run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The gel was then stained with SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Invitrogen). The gel images were obtained by a gel imager (Printgraph; Atto, Tokyo, Japan).Northern blot analysis.Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (38), with some modifications. Briefly, viral RNAs were extracted from purified viruses or from plasmid-transfected or virus-infected HRT-18G cells using Isogen reagents (Nippon Gene). Viral (10\u2009ng) or intracellular (1\u2009\u03bcg) RNAs were denatured in denaturing buffer (50% formamide and 17.8% formalin in 1% morpholinepropanesulfonic acid [MOPS] buffer), separated on 1.5% denaturing agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred onto a nylon membrane with a molecular weight marker (BioDynamics Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan). Biotin-labeled strand-specific RNA probes for PB2 (hybridizing to nucleotides [nt] 15 to 1257), PB1 (nt 26 to 1260), P3 (nt 23 to 1038), HEF (nt 27 to 1017), NP (nt 28 to 954), M (nt 29 to 1220), NS (to nt 29 to 868) vRNA, and 18S rRNA were synthesized using a biotin-11-UTP (Roche) and a T7 RNA expression kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Detection of RNA segments was performed using an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and a digoxigenin (DIG) block and wash buffer set (Roche), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The signals were detected with Clarity ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and blot images were obtained with an Image Quant LAS 4000 Mini system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).Data availability.Sequences were deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession numbers LC522351 to LC522357.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ben M.

{"text": "Development of a rapid, simple and efficient one-pot cloning method for a reverse genetics system of broad subtypes of influenza A virus. \nAbstract \n The reverse genetics (RG) system of influenza A viruses is well established. However, the conventional sequence-dependent method for cloning influenza genome segments is time-consuming and requires multiple processes (eg. enzyme digestion and ligation) and exhibits low cloning efficiency compared to the sequence-independent cloning method. In this study, we improved influenza genome cloning into the pHW2000 vector for an RG system by incorporating a sequence-independent circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) approach which requires only 2 steps (reverse transcription and one-pot CPEC-PCR) and takes about 4\u2009hours before\u00a0the transformation. The specifically designed viral gene and vector primers used for CPEC-PCR have improved cloning efficiency ranging from 63.6 to 100% based on the results of gene-specific colony PCR which was additionally confirmed by enzyme digestion. We successfully cloned all genes from broad subtypes of influenza A viruses (H1-H12, N1-N9) and rescued by the\u00a0RG system. Our results demonstrate that this method\u2014one-Pot cloning for influenza A virus\u2014was efficient in terms of required time and cloning rate. In conclusion, the novel cloning method for influenza A virus will contribute to a significant reduction in the time required for genetic studies of emerging influenza viruses.\n\n\n\nIntroductionThe influenza A viruses (IAVs) which belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, consist of eight segments (ie, PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS)1. These viruses have caused pandemics resulting in the death of millions of people worldwide and still pose threats and challenges to public health. Thus, global surveillance and intensive studies to understand the behavior and pathogenicity of these viruses are critical for understanding and controlling the spread of infections. The development of reverse genetics (RG) system which enables the rescue of recombinant influenza A viruses using plasmids became an invaluable tool for studying and understanding viral phenotypes, pathogenesis and/or transmission and to improve the development of anti-viral strategies2,3,4,5,6, including new vaccines7. Various studies on potential improvements of the RG system have been shown to hasten and simplify the process required for cloning of the eight fragments of the influenza virus into plasmids for influenza virus rescue\u2014a critical component of the RG system8. The current process for a sequence-dependent cloning viral genes into an RG vector involves the sequencing, restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of viral genes and vector to generate successful clones, which are onerous and subject to certain limitations such as a lack of appropriate restriction-sites and inefficient enzymatic steps9,10,11. Thus, several groups have recently reported restriction enzyme-free8,12,13 and ligation-independent recombination-based approaches for influenza genes cloning14 considered sequence-independent cloning approaches, each having their own special characteristics and advantages.The recent development of a gene cloning method which relies on a mechanism similar to a\u00a0polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of DNA sequences, the so-called \u201cCircular Polymerase Extension Cloning\u201d (CPEC), was developed as a simplified sequence-independent cloning technology based entirely on the polymerase extension mechanism15. It has notable advantages (eg, high cloning accuracy and efficiency) and uses double-stranded overlapping inserts and vector directly without any treatment such as T4 DNA polymerase treatment or UDG enzymes15.Thus, to accelerate the cloning process for influenza genes, we report rapid cloning of influenza virus genes by applying the CPEC method and improved it by developing a method that can perform simultaneously the amplification of specific influenza gene and CPEC cloning in a one-pot reaction which greatly shortens the cloning process. The new strategy was evaluated and confirmed by cloning the eight influenza genes from a wide range of influenza subtypes (H1-H12 and N1-N9) and rescuing these clones using the RG system.ResultsConcept design of the modified pHW2000 vector and PCR primersPrimers were designed by extending homologous sequences containing Uni 12 or Uni 13 and conserved viral gene-specific sequences of the 8 influenza segments (Table\u00a01) between the polI terminator and polI promotor sequences of the pHW2000 vector (Fig.\u00a01). Using these designed primers and PCR, a linear amplified vector amplicon was obtained. This amplicon was then digested by DpnI and confirmed by gel electrophoresis and viewing under UV light. The results of gel electrophoresis revealed PCR-generated vector amplicons roughly 3\u2009kb in size (Fig.\u00a02a). Furthermore, purified vectors were obtained through gel purification; the eluted vector DNA samples had a concentration of roughly 100~150\u2009ng/\u00b5l acquired from 100\u2009\u03bcL PCR reactions for each gene-specific vector. The suitability of these vectors for CPEC cloning was confirmed by ensuring that they contained uni12 or 13 sequences and conserved viral gene-specific regions adjacent to the polI terminator or the vector promoter (data not shown).Table 1 Reverse transcription primers and primer sets used for vector and influenza A gene-specific PCR amplification.Full size tableFigure 1Schematic diagram of the one-pot PCR method for influenza gene cloning. (a) First, reverse transcription was performed using the modified uni12 designed primers that are complementary to the 12 conserved nucleotides at the 3\u2032-end of the influenza vRNA to generate complementary DNA (cDNA). (b) A gene-specific modified reverse genetics plasmid (pHW2000) was then generated using the designed vector primers to form a linear gene-specific construct for cloning of an individual gene. (c) cDNA obtained from reverse transcription and the gel-purified linear vectors are necessary for one-pot PCR. The insert (amplified from cDNA; 1~25 cycles) generated using gene-specific primers results in vector-complementary ends. Following denaturation and annealing [26\u201335 cycles of Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC)], the insert and vector extend using each other as a\u00a0template to complete a full circle. (d) The PCR product with the completely assembled plasmids was used for transformation without further purification.Full size imageFigure 2Gel electrophoresis analysis of specific vectors, inserts, and CPEC products. (a) Gel analysis of PCR amplicons for modified linear-specific vectors using study-specific primers (as previously described). (b) Full-length amplification of all eight genes (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) from cDNA of PR8 to confirm\u00a0the efficiency of the designed primers. (c) Gel electrophoresis analysis of the final assembly products for each influenza segment after 25-cycles of CPEC. All reaction mixtures were separated on a 0.9% agarose gel and visualized using gel red staining. Each gel figures were derived from the\u00a0complete set of PCR products run in independent gels and were cropped in an appropriate size. S: DNA size ladder (1\u2009kb).Full size imageTo generate cDNA by reverse transcription\u2014a process which enabled the amplification of all eight segments of influenza A viral RNA\u2014two primers were designed to include sequences complementary to the conserved vRNA-termini applicable to all subtypes of Influenza A virus (Table\u00a01)16,17,18. The modified primers also enabled high-amplification efficiency of longer P genes (ie, PB2, PB1, PA) compared to the use of the conventional single uni12 primer (data not shown). Subsequently, to verify the newly designed primers for amplification of viral gene segments, PCR amplicons of the influenza genes were generated using the specifically designed viral gene segment amplifying primers (Table\u00a01) which contain 25\u201337 nucleotides, homologous with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminus of the gene specific vectors\u2014a component critical for CPEC cloning. The amplified viral gene segments were confirmed to be the appropriate size (including the newly designed primers) as shown in Fig.\u00a02b.Segment amplification using cDNA and integration of CPEC cloning into a one-pot reactionThe advantage of our one-pot CPEC strategy for influenza A virus cloning is that it can reduce the multiple steps required for the traditional approach (eg, confirmation and elution of PCR products in an agarose gel, enzyme digestion, and ligation), thereby significantly reducing the time and labor required. To evaluate the effectiveness of this novel method, we firstly cloned the PR8 virus. All eight influenza genes were amplified from the cDNA of PR8\u2014using gene-specific primers\u2014for 25 cycles and the PCR conditions described in the materials and methods section. Without separating the PCR amplicons on an agarose gel and purifying them, 300\u2009ng of specific linear vector previously amplified as described in the materials and methods was added directly to the PCR reaction tube. CPEC cloning was then performed for 10 cycles (Fig.\u00a02c). After assembly of the insert with the vector, the PCR products were directly transformed into competent cells. Each of the steps mentioned above (including RNA extraction) were completed within 4~5\u2009hours. At day 2, 58\u201398 colonies were obtained for each influenza genes wherein 11 colonies were randomly selected from each plate for colony PCR screening, using the gene-specific primers used for segment amplification. Positive clones were identified by the correct size of each influenza gene and summarized in Table\u00a02. The 11 colonies were also further used to make minipreps and were digested by NcoI enzyme and compared to the positive control (ie, conventionally cloned PR8 plasmids) (Fig.\u00a03). The enzyme digestion of miniprep samples which were seeded from colony-PCR positive samples is optional due to the highly correlated result between PCR and enzyme digestion (Fig.\u00a03). Positive colonies resulted in amplicons and digestion patterns consistent with the positive control (Table\u00a02); results were further confirmed by sequencing. In summary, the percentage for positive clones for each influenza genes were 63.6% (PB2), 72.7% (PB1), 63.6% (PA), 63.6% (HA), 81.8% (NP), 72.7% (NA), 72.7% (M) and 100% (NS), indicating that this novel method is accurate and efficient in terms of the cloning rate despite the significantly reduced processing time and step. Thus, through this developed strategy, we rapidly and efficiently acquired all positive clones for the eight influenza genes from the cDNA of PR8 after using this one-pot CPEC approach.Table 2 Cloning efficiency of the tested one-pot CPEC approach.Full size tableFigure 3Confirmation by enzyme digestion of PR8-specific genes cloned in the reverse genetic vector pHW2000 using a one-pot CPEC cloning method. NcoI-restriction enzyme analysis of plasmid DNA purified from transformants revealed digestion patterns similar to the positive control. Each gel figures were derived from\u00a0the complete set of PCR products run in independent gels and were cropped in an appropriate size. The gels were grouped according to the 8 influenza genes (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and\u00a0NS). S: DNA size ladder (1\u2009kb); 1~11: samples 1 to 11 colonies for each group; C: positive control using specific PR8 plasmid from conventional cloning; *samples with similar digestion patterns to the positive control.Full size imageCloning of influenza genes and virus rescue of broad subtypes of Influenza A virusesTo further evaluate the applicability of the newly developed cloning method, we applied it to all subtypes of influenza viruses (ie, a total of 15 representative influenza viruses from H1 to H12 and N1 to N9 subtypes) which include (i) human H1N1 influenza virus, (ii) highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus and (iii) several avian influenza viruses isolated from wild birds (Table\u00a03). As a result, all 8 influenza segments of each virus were successfully cloned (Table\u00a03). To further evaluate the efficiency of the cloned genes when used in the virus rescue, we performed an RG system using all 8 cloned genes of each of the above-mentioned viruses. Each of the individually cloned genes in the genetic background of PR8 viruses, and most of the whole genomes of wild-type viruses were successfully rescued (Table\u00a03). These results confirmed that the method developed for cloning of influenza A genes for an RG study was rapid and highly efficient.Table 3 Various subtypes of influenza virus cloned and rescued in this study.Full size tableDiscussionIn order to simplify the process and reduce the time required for cloning methods used to: (i) analyze the molecular characterization of influenza viruses and (ii) produce vaccines and recombinant viruses, we modified the traditional approach and cloned 8 influenza A virus gene segments into the vector (pHW2000) using the primers described above. The whole process involves a single PCR process and transformation after reverse transcription of the viral RNA. Therefore, sequencing, enzyme digestion, and ligation\u2014steps required for traditional sequence-dependent cloning methods\u2014are omitted, and cloning time is greatly reduced (Fig.\u00a04).Figure 4Illustration of streamlined schemes of various cloning methods for reverse genetics systems of influenza viruses.

In contrast to other sequence-independent cloning methods (eg, LIC, UDG-based methods, SLIC and PIPE), the CPEC method uses double-stranded overlapping inserts and vector directly without any treatment15, making it more convenient.In the first step of the one-pot reaction (ie, amplification of the insert from cDNA), only a light band of the correct size was visible upon gel electrophoresis of the PCR product (data not shown), however, positive clones were obtained after the subsequent CPEC reaction (ie, addition of the vector). This suggests a highly efficient method requiring only a small amount of insert to obtain positive clones. Furthermore, the elimination of gel purification after insert amplification is another advantage of this novel approach as it prevents the possible loss of PCR amplicons during extraction from agarose gels, particularly when the abundance of amplicons is low. In this regard, the cloning efficiency in traditional method was low when tested in comparison to that of the One-pot cloning using equal viral gene segment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1 and Table\u00a0S1). In addition, due to the limited use of digestive enzymes such as BsmBI and BsaI19, the increasing number of digestive cuts in viral gene insert consequently decrease the rate of cloning efficiency (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1 and Table\u00a0S1). However, the developed one-pot method has successfully cloned these genes, suggesting a higher efficiency and improved method of cloning for such genes.We designed our CPEC based on the results of previous studies which revealed that 10 cycles of CPEC was sufficient for cloning15, thus keeping the number of PCR cycles to a minimum. Additionally, it is not recommended to have too many cycles for the CPEC step as concatemers may form15. Since CPEC is not an amplification process and does not accumulate mutations, it was reported that a smaller number of cycles (ie, one five minute denature-annealing-extension cycle) is sufficient for optimal single-gene cloning; 5\u201325 cycles were recommended for multi-fragment cloning15. The PCR polymerases used in the reactions were also considered. In this study, we have used the Phusion DNA polymerase, an enzyme with high fidelity and processivity that had been shown to be highly efficient for the demanding task of CPEC-mediated cloning15.This study also demonstrated the efficiency in an RG system using clones produced by this one-pot cloning method. The method was also applied to clone the gene segments of various influenza A viruses. All plasmids cloned by this method were individually rescued in the backbone of PR8 in an efficient manner. However, even though some representative subtypes of avian viruses (ie, H5N3, H7N7, H9N2, and H10N4) were not successfully rescued using their whole genome\u2014possibly due to the low viral replicability of these viruses in a human cell line (293\u2009T)\u2014the majority of the subtypes of avian and human viruses tested could be successfully rescued using the novel one-pot cloning approach described here. Thus, the method is applicable to the cloning of various subtypes of influenza A viruses. Furthermore, although the pHW2000 vector as a virus rescue platform was specifically used in the current study, the method could also be applicable for the other vectors for influenza rescue system by slight modification of the vector and insert primers based on the sequence termini of the target vector, thus, suggesting a high applicability of the method for cloning of influenza A virus rescue system.In comparison with other methods for cloning influenza A genes for RG, our newly developed method was confirmed to be a simple, rapid and efficient cloning process with utility in conjunction with an RG system. Some recent similar papers also reported on newly developed approaches for cloning influenza genes with their unique advantages and characteristics (eg, restriction enzyme and ligation-free processes)12,13,16. Each of these appears to be improvements over the traditional method for cloning influenza genes. However, neither of these approaches leverage a one-pot reaction involving amplification of influenza genes and integration of the CPEC method to assemble the insert with the vector to generate a product that can be used for transformation in reduced time. Thus, the novel method described herein eliminates the ligation process, gel purification of amplified inserts and the use of restriction enzymes, thereby accelerating the cloning process and offering additional advantages (eg, high efficiency, convenience and cost-effectiveness).Materials and MethodsViruses and cellsMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza, Allendale, NJ) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), vitamins (Gibco) and 1% antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, Gibco-Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney (293\u2009T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Gibco-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. Both cell types were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2. A wide range of influenza viruses (avian and human isolates) were used in this study, including: (i) A/duck/Korea/436/2014 (H1N8) (W436), (ii) A/duck/Korea/369/2008 (H2N3) (W369), (iii) A/duck/Korea/538/2016 (H3N8) (W538), (iv) A/duck/Korea/137/2006 (H4N4) (W137), (v) A/duck/Korea/562/2016 (H5N3) (W562), (vi) A/duck/Korea/502/2015 (H6N2) (W502), (vii) A/duck/Korea/557/2016 (H7N7) (W557), (viii) A/duck/Korea/563/2016 (H8N6) (W563), (ix) A/duck/Korea/233/2007 (H9N2) (W233), (x) A/duck/Korea/530/2016 (H10N4) (W530), (xi) A/duck/Korea/552/2016 (H11N9) (W552), (xii) A/duck/Korea/373/2008 (H12N5) (W373), (xiii) A/Environment/Korea/W468/2015 (H5N8) (W468), and (xiv) A/Korea/CNH1/2016 (H1N1) (CNH1). In addition, 8 genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) virus were also used as genetic backbone for the individual rescue of the plasmids from abovementioned viruses to verify that the individual clones of the viruses were properly working. The viruses were propagated in specific pathogen\u2013free (SPF) 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until use. Viral RNA of propagated viruses were extracted for cloning by using QIamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. HPAI H5N8 (W468) virus experiments were done in biosafety level three (BSL3+) laboratory approved by the Korea Center for Diseases Control.Primer designThe specific primers designed to amplify influenza A genes and modified vectors for this novel cloning approach are presented in Table\u00a01. Due to the highly conserved sequence moiety in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-translational region (NTR) of the influenza A viral gene segments, primers for the amplification of segment-specific vectors were designed with extending segment-specific NTR regions to each gene-segments in order to increase the cloning specificity. Forward vector-specific primers were designed with elongated 5\u2032-ends containing conserved 2\u20138 viral gene-specific nucleotides (nts) and the uni13 sequence (CCTGCTTTCGC) adjacent to the 30 nucleotides in polymerase I promoter sequence of the pHW2000 plasmid. Reverse primers contain the reverse complement of the conserved viral gene specific (2\u201313 nts) and the uni12 sequence (AGCGAAAGCAGG or AGCAAAAGCAGG) adjacent to the 37 nucleotides in a terminator sequence of the pHW2000 plasmid (Table\u00a01). For amplification of the influenza A genes, we used gene-specific primers described previously19 but with modifications (Table\u00a01) by adding complementary sequences (AAGTTGGGGGGG and GGTTATT) to the forward and reverse primers, respectively to generate a sequence overlapping with the vector. The primers associated with the NA gene are further subdivided according to subtype (for N1, N2, N4, N5, and N8; for N3; for N6, N7 and for N9)19. The primers used in the reverse transcription step were designed by extending the vector sequence (CGAAGTTGGGGGGG) with the uni12 (G and A) sequence (Table\u00a01).Preparation of a gene-specific vectorTo generate a linearized gene-specific vector applicable to all subtypes of influenza A virus, we performed PCR using the primers described above and in Table\u00a01. The PCR reaction was performed using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and a mixture containing 20\u2009\u00b5l of 5x HF buffer, 10\u2009\u00b5l of 2\u2009mM dNTP, 2\u2009\u00b5l of 50\u2009mM MgCl2, 4\u2009\u00b5l of 5 pmol primer (each), 100\u2009ng of empty pHW2000 plasmid DNA which is digested and linearized by KpnI enzyme, 2\u2009\u00b5l of Phusion polymerase, and distilled water (DW) for a total reaction volume of 100\u2009\u00b5l. The PCR conditions are as follows: one cycle of 98\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s (initial denaturation) followed by 35 cycles of 98\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009seconds, 58\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009seconds and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 90\u2009seconds, and a final elongation of 72\u2009\u00b0C for 7\u2009minutes. PCR products were digested using DpnI to get remove methylated DNA (2\u2009\u00b5l enzyme in a total reaction of 100\u2009\u00b5l incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009hours). The DpnI-digested PCR amplicons were purified with QIAquick\u00ae Gel Extraction Kit (Quiagen, Valencia CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Preparation of viral cDNAThe viral RNAs from avian and human influenza viruses were extracted using QIamp Viral RNA Kit as previously described. For cDNA synthesis, reverse transcription was performed using a 6:4 ratio mixture of the two modified primers Uni12-CPEC (G) and Uni12-CPEC (A) (Table\u00a01). Briefly, RT-PCR included a reaction mixture containing 37\u2009\u00b5l of vRNAs, 5\u2009\u00b5l of 2\u2009mM dNTP and 2\u2009\u00b5l of RT primer mixtures (each 5pmol/\u00b5l): (i) annealed at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009minutes and (ii) quickly transferred to ice for cooling before adding 5\u2009\u00b5l of 10x buffer and 1\u2009\u00b5l of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase to a total reaction volume of 50\u2009\u00b5l and (iii) incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009hour. The reaction was halted by enzyme inactivation (72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009minutes).One-pot CPEC cloningGene-specific amplification and CPEC cloning were performed simultaneously in a one-pot PCR reaction. The PCR amplification mixture contained 6\u2009\u00b5l of cDNA obtained from reverse transcription described above, 10\u2009\u00b5l of 5x HF buffer, 5\u2009\u00b5l of 2\u2009mM dNTP, 1\u2009\u00b5l of 50\u2009mM MgCl2, 4\u2009\u00b5l of 5 pmol gene-specific primer set (2\u2009\u00b5l each), 1\u2009\u00b5l of Phusion Polymerase, and DW to a total reaction volume of 50\u2009\u00b5l. After the initial denaturation step (98\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009seconds), PCR conditions were 25 cycles of: (i) denaturation (98\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009seconds), (ii) annealing (58\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009seconds), and extension step at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 90\u2009seconds. Next, 300\u2009ng of the gel-purified gene-specific linear vector was added to the reaction and PCR was continued for an additional 10 cycles. The reaction was halted with a final extension (5\u2009minutes at 72\u2009\u00b0C). We transformed 5\u2009\u00b5l of the CPEC-PCR product into 50\u2009\u00b5l of competent cells by heat-shock and plated all on ampicillin plates. The remaining of CPEC-PCR product (45\u2009\u00b5l) can be used to analyze viral genome sequence (Fig.\u00a02c), when the viral genome sequence is needed. Random independent colonies were selected and used as a template for single-colony PCR using gene-specific primers to verify the presence of the correct insert. The confirmed colonies were further seeded appropriately and were prepared for plasmid DNA purification by miniprep or midiprep.Virus rescue by transfectionThe 8 gene-containing plasmids of each of the viral strains used in this study cloned using the one-pot CPEC cloning method described here were used in the genetic reverse system to generate recombinant viruses. Briefly, 1\u2009\u00b5g of each of the eight segment plasmids (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, NS) were mixed with 182\u2009\u00b5l of Opti-MEM medium followed by addition of 18\u2009\u00b5l of TransIT\u00ae-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45\u2009minutes. 800\u2009\u00b5l of Opti-MEM was added and mixed, and then the mixture was added onto the co-cultured MDCK and 293\u2009T cells prepared in 6-well plates. After 18\u2009hours of transfection, the transfection media was replaced with 1\u2009ml of fresh Opti-MEM containing antibiotics and further incubated for 24\u2009hours. 1\u2009ml of Opti-MEM containing 1\u2009\u00b5g/ml TPCK-Trypsin was added and incubated further for 48\u2009hours. At day 5 post-transfection, the transfection supernatant samples were injected into 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and incubated for 48 to 72\u2009hours. The allantoic fluids were harvested and confirmed for successful rescue of the virus by hemagglutination test and sequences confirmed by RT-PCR. Two additional blind passages were performed when the desired RG-virus was not detected in the first egg passage. Furthermore, two more rescue procedures were also performed when the initial rescue was not successful."}
{"text": "Effect of the fourth nucleotide at the 3' end of neuraminidase and matrix viral genomic RNA on the pathogenicity of influenza virus A/PR/8/34. \nAbstract\n\n\n\nTwelve nucleotides located at the 3\u2032 end of viral genomic RNA (vRNA) are conserved among influenza A viruses (IAV) and have a promoter function. Hoffmann's 8-plasmid reverse genetics vector system introduced mutations at position 4, C nucleotide (C4) to U nucleotide (U4), of the 3\u2032 ends of neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) vRNAs of wild-type A/PR/8/34 (PR8). This resulted in a constellation of C4 and U4 vRNAs coding for low (polymerases) and relatively high (all others) copy number proteins, respectively. U4 has been reported to increase promoter activity in comparison to C4, but the constellation effect on the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of reverse genetics PR8 (rgPR8) has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we generated 3 recombinant viruses with C4 in the NA and/or M vRNAs and rgPR8 by using reverse genetics and compared their pathobiological traits. The mutant viruses showed lower replication efficiency than rgPR8 due to the low transcription levels of NA and/or M genes. Furthermore, C4 in the NA and/or M vRNAs induced lower PR8 virus pathogenicity in BALB/c mice. The results suggest that the constellation of C4 and U4 among vRNAs may be one of the multigenic determinants of IAV pathogenicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: \n\ninfluenza A virus; pathogenicity; promoter; reverse genetics; viral replication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to:\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe noncoding regions (NCRs) of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of viral RNA (vRNA) of influenza A virus (IAV) form a \u2018corkscrew\u2019-like structure and function as promoters for the transcription of messenger (mRNA), complementary RNA, and viral genomic RNA (vRNA) [2, 5, 16]. The promoter function is reported to be localized to 12 conserved nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of vRNA, and nucleotides 9 to 11 were shown to be crucial for promoter activity [20]. Mutations at positions 11 and 12 of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of neuraminidase (NA) vRNA of influenza A/WSN/33 reduced the NA mRNA and protein levels, as well as the virus titer, and resulted in attenuated phenotypes in mice [6, 21]. Therefore, the NCRs of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of vRNA may have an important role in viral pathogenicity as well as viral gene expression.\nThe nucleotide at position 4 of the 3\u2032 end of NA vRNA has been shown to affect the transcription of vRNA, and a U nucleotide at position 4 (U4) increased the transcription level of NA vRNA above that from a C nucleotide (C4) [14]. Moreover, a U4 to C4 mutation affects viral transcription and replication activity by down-regulating polymerase recognition activity [11]. However, various mutant influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) viruses possessing different combinations of C4 and U4 did not produce different viral titers [4]. During adaptation in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs), wild-type (wt) PR8 acquired multiple mutations in coding genes related to increased viral replication efficiency, and the genome segments of a high yield PR8 strain (reverse genetics PR8, rgPR8) was used for generation of recombinant vaccine strains by using reverse genetics. During analysis of the sequences of NCRs, we observed different combinations of U4 and C4 in NCRs of wtPR8 and rgPR8. The polymerases (PB1, PB2, and PA), NA, and matrix (M) vRNAs of wtPR8 possessed C4 rather than U4, but those of rgPR8 acquired U4 mutations in NCRs of the NA and M vRNAs [4, 8, 9]. Although PR8 virus have been widely used to inactivated vaccine backbone strain, the effect of U4 in NCRs of the NA and M vRNAs of rgPR8 have not been fully elucidated [8, 17].\nIn the present study, we generated 4 recombinant viruses with C4 in the NA and/or M vRNAs and an rgPR8-like constellation of C4 and U4 by undertaking reverse genetics. We then compared their replication efficiency in ECEs, transcription levels of vRNA and mRNA of the NA and/or M genome segments in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and their pathogenicity in mice. Our results indicate that C4 in both the NA and M vRNAs decreased virus replication efficiency in ECEs and pathogenicity in mice. Thus, the position 4 nucleotide in the 3\u2032 end and the constellation of C4 and U4 among vRNAs may be multigenic determinants of pathogenicity. Studies to reveal the profiles of the promoters of IAVs may be valuable in the prediction of potential pathogenicity.\n\n\n\n\nGo to:\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nViruses, eggs, cells, and plasmids\nThe rgPR8 virus was generated by using Hoffmann's 8-plasmid reverse genetics vector system [8] and was passaged three times in 10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) ECEs (VALO BioMedia, USA) before use. All of the influenza viruses were inoculated in 10-day-old ECEs via the allantoic cavity route, and the eggs were then incubated for 36 to 72 h. After chilling at 4\u2103 overnight, the allantoic fluid was harvested and stored at \u221270\u2103 until further use.\nThe 293T and MDCK cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (USA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The 293T cells were used to generate recombinant viruses through the reverse genetic process.\n\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis\nThe bidirectional transcription vector, pHW2000, and 8 plasmid vectors with 8 genome segments of PR8 were obtained by following the process described by Hoffmann et al. [8]. To understand the effects of C4 in the M and NA vRNAs, we mutated nucleotide sequence T4 of the pHW197-M and pHW196-NA plasmids into C4 by applying site-directed mutagenesis (iNtRON Biotechnology, Korea). The mutated plasmids were named pHW197-M-C4 and pHW196-NA-C4. The mutagenesis primer sets are listed in Table 1, and the constellations of C4 and U4 among the viral genomes of each virus are presented in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\nPrimers used in this study\n\n\n\n\nClick for larger image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\nNucleotide sequence of the 3\u2032\u2013noncoding region (NCR) of wild-type (wt) A/PR/8/34 (PR8), reverse genetics (rg) PR8, and the recombinant PR8 viruses generated in the present study\n\n\n\n\nClick for larger image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecombinant virus generation by reverse genetics\nThe rgPR8 strain was generated by transfection using Hoffmann et al.'s 8 reverse genetics plasmids [8] as previously described, with some modifications. The recombinant viruses that possessed C4 in NA, M, and both vRNAs were generated by replacing pHW196-NA and/or pHW197-M with pHW196-NA-C4 and/or pHW197-M-C4 and were named rPR8-NA-prom, rPR8-M-prom, and rPR8-MN-prom (wtPR8), respectively. Briefly, 293T cells were cultured (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well in 6-well plates) and transfected with 300 ng of each plasmid by using lipofectamine 2000 and plus reagents (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 1 mL of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After overnight incubation, 1 mL of fresh medium and 0.5 mg/mL of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were added. After 24 h, the culture medium was harvested and 200 \u00b5L were injected into 10-day-old SPF ECEs via the allantoic cavity route. After incubating for 2 to 3 days, the allantoic fluid was harvested and tested with an hemagglutination test using 1% (v/v) chicken red blood cells according to the World Health Organization Manual on Animal Influenza Diagnosis and Surveillance. All experiments were performed after obtaining permission from the Seoul National University Institutional Biosafety Committee (SNUIBC) (approval No. SNUIBC-R150729-1).\n\n\nViral growth kinetics\nEach recombinant virus (10 EID50/200 \u00b5L/ECE; EID50, 50% egg infectious dose) was inoculated into eighteen 10-day-old SPF ECEs, and 3 ECEs were harvested at 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 48 h post-inoculation. To measure the virus titer at each time interval, the pooled sample was serially diluted 10-fold from 10\u22121 to 10\u22129, and each dilution was inoculated into MDCK cells. The 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID50/mL) was calculated more than three times by using the Spearman-Karber method [7].\n\n\nvRNA and mRNA quantification\nTo determine the effects of the introduced mutations, the transcription levels of vRNA and mRNA of the M and NA genome segments were measured by performing two-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as previously described [10, 12], with some modifications. Briefly, the recombinant viruses were infected to confluent MDCK cells in a 12-well plate at 0.001 multiplicity of infection for 1 h and washed twice with phosphate buffer saline. Cells were cultured in maintenance medium (DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin [fraction V] [Roche, Switzerland], 20 mM HEPES, antibiotic-antimycotic [Gibco, USA], and 1 \u00b5g/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin [Sigma-Aldrich]) at 37\u2103 under humidified 5% CO2. Cells were harvested after incubation for 6 h, and total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). For the cDNA synthesis, an AmfiRivert cDNA Synthesis Platinum kit (GenDEPOT, USA) was used with the tagged primers (Table 1). Real-time PCR was conducted with SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) and the specific primer sets (Table 1) by using an ABI StepOne Real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA). Transcription levels were normalized by using transcription levels of cellular GAPDH genes in the infected cells as an internal control. The relative transcription levels of vRNA and mRNA of each recombinant virus were represented by the ratio to those of rgPR8. Three independent experiments were performed.\n\n\nPathogenicity in BALB/c mice\nFive-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Narabiotech (Korea), and the mouse pathogenicity test was conducted by BioPOA (Korea). The mortality and weight loss of BALB/c mice were measured after intranasal inoculation of rPR8, rPR8-NA-prom, rPR8-M-prom, and rPR8-MN-prom (wtPR8) as previously described [13], with some modifications. Briefly, each recombinant virus was diluted to 105 and 104 EID50/50 \u00b5L, and 5 mice were assigned to receive one dilution of the virus. Mice were anesthetized with Zoletil (15 mg/kg; Virbac, France) and mortality and weight loss were observed every day for 12 days. When the body weight of a mouse had decreased by more than 20%, the mouse was considered moribund and was killed by CO2 asphyxiation. All procedures performed in studies involving animals were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee at BioPOA, Korea (approval No. BP-2017-001-2). The mouse experiments were carried out in accordance with the protocol of the National Institutes of Health's Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe significance of body weight and virus titer changes was evaluated by using one-way analysis-of-variance (IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 23; IBM, USA). The mortality differences observed in pathogenicity testing were assessed by using the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test, 95% confidence intervals). Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 and p<0.001.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to:\n\nResults\n\n\nGrowth kinetics of recombinant viruses in ECEs\nWe generated four recombinant PR8 viruses: a rgPR8-like constellation of C4 and U4 (rgPR8), C4 in NA vRNA (rPR8-NA-prom), C4 in M vRNA (rPR8-M-prom), and a wtPR8-like constellation of C4 and U4 (rPR8-MN-prom) (Table 2), and compared their replication efficiency in ECEs. The rgPR8 virus could replicate in ECEs at 8 h post-inoculation, and its virus titers were significantly higher than those of recombinant viruses with C4 instead of U4 in the M and/or NA vRNAs at all of the time intervals that were compared (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1\nComparison of virus titers of recombinant viruses with different constellation of C nucleotide and U nucleotide at position 4 in the 3\u2032-end of the noncoding region of the viral genome. Each recombinant virus (10 EID50/200 \u00b5L/ECE; EID50, 50% egg infectious dose; ECE, embryonated chicken egg) was inoculated into eighteen 10-day-old specific pathogen-free ECEs, and 3 ECEs were harvested at 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 48 h post-inoculation.

The U4 to C4 substitutions in NA vRNA decreased both vRNA and mRNA transcriptions of the NA genome segment by more than 50%. Similar to the NA results, C4 in M vRNA reduced the vRNA and mRNA transcriptions of the M genome segment. The wtPR8 (rPR8-MN-prom) showed downregulated transcription of both M and NA viral genome segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2\nRelative transcription levels of viral genomic RNA (vRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) of recombinant viruses.

Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were infected by recombinant viruses at 0.001 multiplicity of infection at 37\u2103, and cell lysates were harvested at 6 h post-inoculation. The vRNA and mRNA transcription levels were normalized by the transcription levels of GAPDH gene of the infected cells. The relative transcription levels of vRNA and mRNA of each recombinant virus were represented by the ratio to those of rgPR8. The data presented are the average of three independent experiments. **Asterisks represent a significant difference between the rgPR8 and other recombinant viruses (p < 0.001).\n\n\n\n\nClick for larger image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of pathogenicity of recombinant viruses in mice\nBecause the U4 to C4 substitutions affect the viral replication efficiency, we compared the pathogenicity of recombinant viruses with that of rgPR8 in BALB/c mice. The 105 EID50 inoculation of rPR8-NA-prom, rPR8-M-prom, and wtPR8 (rPR8-MN-prom) led to weight loss less than that of rgPR8, and caused less mortality and a greater mean time to death in mice (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the inoculation of 104 EID50 recombinant viruses did not cause any death in contrast to that of 104 EID50 rgPR8 (Fig. 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3\nComparison of mouse pathogenicity of recombinant viruses.

The C4 to U4 substitution has been shown to increase the transcription of NA vRNA of WSN/33 by 20-fold, but various combinations of C4 and U4 in vRNAs of PR8 did not affect the virus replication efficiency in 293T cells [14, 22]. In the present study, we showed the virus titers of an rgPR8-like constellation of C4 and U4 (rgPR8) were significantly higher than those of C4 in NA vRNA (rPR8-NA-prom), M vRNA (rPR8-M-prom), and both vRNAs (rPR8-MN-prom) at all time intervals that were compared (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). Considering that rgPR8 has constellations of U4 in 5 vRNA coding proteins (hemagglutinin [HA], nucleoprotein [NP], NA, M, and nonstructural [NS]) with relatively high copy numbers and C4 in 3 vRNA coding proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) with relatively low copy numbers, an optimal constellation of C4 and U4 may result in a harmonized production of viral proteins to form virus particles. NA is important for virus budding, and matrix 1 protein is one of the major structural proteins that helps to export ribonucleoprotein complex to the cytoplasm [1, 15]. Therefore, U4 to C4 substitutions in the NA and/or M vRNAs may cause a decrease in the replication efficiency of rPR8-NA-prom, rPR8-M-prom, and rPR8-MN-prom (wtPR8). The virus titer of a recombinant PR8 virus generated with 8 plasmids with C4 was slightly higher than that of another PR8 virus generated with 8 plasmids with U4. However, the virus titers of 8 types of recombinant PR8 viruses with one C4 genome segment were not improved [4]. Thus, balanced production of low copy (PB1, PB2, and PA) and relatively high copy (HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) number viral protein transcripts by weak (C4) and strong (U4) promoters, respectively, may also be important for efficient virus replication.\nRelative vRNA and mRNA transcription levels of the NA and M genome segments of recombinant viruses demonstrated that the U4 to C4 substitutions decreased both vRNA and mRNA transcription of NA and M genome segments (Fig. 2). The previously reported effects of C4 to U4 substitution on vRNA and mRNA transcription have been inconsistent. Lee and Seong [14] reported U4 downregulated vRNA but upregulated mRNA transcription levels. However, Jiang et al. [11] demonstrated C4 decreased both vRNA and mRNA transcription in vitro. Because strand-specific real-time RT-PCR with tagged primers could measure the amount of viral genomes more sensitively than conventional real-time RT-PCR or RNase protection assays, we concluded that U4 to C4 substitutions may reduce not only mRNA but also vRNA transcription of NA and/or M genome segments [12].\nReduced levels of NA due to decreased promoter activity by mutations at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 end NCRs of WSN/33 were reported to attenuate mutant viruses in mice [21]. The effect of the position 4 nucleotide on mice pathogenicity of WSN/33 mutants has been demonstrated, but the tested mutant viruses with all U4 or all C4 were considered too artificial [11]. The inoculation of 105 and 104 EID50 dose of rgPR8 to each BALB/c mouse caused 100% mortality (Fig. 3). The inoculation of 105 EID50 dose of rPR8-NA-prom, rPR8-M-prom, and rPR8-MN-prom (wtPR8) caused 80%, 100%, and 80% mortality, respectively, along with greater mean death times. However, 104 EID50 doses did not cause any mortality (Fig. 3). The 50% minimal lethal dose (MLD50) of PR8 is slightly lower than the 104 EID50 dose [19]. However, C4 in NA and/or M genes of PR8 may attenuate the viral pathogenicity to increase MLD50 more than the 104 EID50 dose. According to our results, rgPR8 was more pathogenic than rPR8-NA-prom, rPR8-M-prom, and rPR8-MN-prom (wtPR8) in BALB/c mice. Thus, U4 to C4 mutations in NA and/or M vRNA could attenuate viral pathogenicity of PR8 in BALB/c mice, as suggested previously [11].\nTo date, most full genome sequencing of IAVs has been conducted with primer sets designed on the basis of the conserved nucleotide sequences of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of IAVs [9]. Thus, natural 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 end nucleotide sequences are rarely available among the reports of complete sequences of IAVs. Natural variability of the position 4 nucleotide in 8 vRNAs has been reported, and combinations of C4 and U4 in 8 vRNAs have been more variable than expected [2, 18, 22]. Therefore, sequencing the NCRs of IAVs may reveal important information regarding the variability of promoter profiles among gene segments and virus strains and may provide basic data to predict potential pathogenicity in mice [3, 22]\nIn conclusion, the position 4 nucleotide of NA and M vRNA of IAVs is important for the effective replication of the PR8 virus in ECEs as well as having importance in virus pathogenicity in mice. Furthermore, an appropriate constellation of weak and strong promoters to low and high copy number protein-coding genome segments is important for virus replication and pathogenicity. Thus, sequence analysis of NCRs of a viral genome may be valuable in elucidating potential pathogenicities of IAVs in mice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to:\n\nNotes\n\nConflict of Interest:The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n\nGo to:\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Korea Healthcare Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health & Welfare, Korea (grant No. A103001) and by the BK21 PLUS Program for Creative Veterinary Science Research."}
{"text": "Plasmid-Based Reverse Genetics of Influenza A Virus. \n Abstract \n Influenza A viruses have broad host range with a recognized natural reservoir in wild aquatic birds. From this reservoir, novel strains occasionally emerge with the potential to establish stable lineages in other avian and mammalian species, including humans. Understanding the molecular changes that allow influenza A viruses to change host range is essential to better assess their animal and public health risks. Reverse genetics systems have transformed the ability to manipulate and study negative strand RNA viruses. In the particular case of influenza A viruses, plasmid-based reverse genetics approaches have allowed for a better understanding of, among others, virulence, transmission, mechanisms of antiviral resistance, and the development of alternative vaccines and vaccination strategies. In this chapter we describe the cloning of cDNA copies of viral RNA segments derived from a type A influenza virus into reverse genetics plasmid vectors and the experimental procedures for the successful generation of recombinant influenza A viruses.Key wordsInfluenza A virusPlasmid-based reverse geneticsVirus rescue approachesRecombinant influenza A virusBidirectional plasmids\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDownload protocol PDF\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpringer Nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate Protocols.\u00a0Learn more\n\n\n1 IntroductionInfluenza viruses are single stranded, negative-sense RNA\n\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                \n               viruses with a segmented genome within the family Orthomyxoviridae, which includes seven genera: Influenzavirus\n                \n                \n                \n              \n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n\n                \n                \n                \n               A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C\n\n\n, Influenzavirus D, Thogotovirus\n\n\n, Isavirus\n\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                \n              , and Quaranjavirus [1]. Influenza A virus (IAV) contains eight viral gene segments, which encode at least 12 viral proteins (Fig. 1). Two surface proteins, the trimeric hemagglutinin (HA\n                \n              ) and the tetrameric neuraminidase (NA)\n, are the main antigenic determinants of the virus to which neutralizing antibodies are elicited. IAVs are classified by the antigenic properties of the HA and NA. Currently, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been described [2, 3]. Wild aquatic birds are considered the primary hosts for IAVs in which 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been found (Fig. 2). HA subtypes 17 and 18 in combination with NA subtypes 10 and 11, respectively, have been identified in fruit bats, but not yet in birds [2,3,4]. In aquatic birds\n the majority of influenza A viruses replicate in the cells lining the intestinal tract, cause no apparent disease, and are transmitted by fecal contamination of water [5, 6]. These viruses occasionally establish stable lineages in land-based birds and a limited number of mammalian species including horses, pigs, seals, and humans, usually associated with respiratory illness [7]. Segment exchange\n between influenza A viruses during infection and replication provides a mechanism to increase both the genetic diversity and potentially the host range of these viruses. Human influenza pandemic strains have an origin in the avian reservoir either from a direct avian source, as in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic [8], or through intermediary hosts, such as pigs, as in the 2009 pandemic [9]. Typically, IAVs from one animal species must undergo some change, either in the form of specific amino acid changes and/or reassortment \n\nbefore they can cross species barriers. Understanding influenza host switching\n is very complex and represents a monumental task; however, reverse genetics has allowed for important advances with respect to understanding molecular changes associated with cross-species transmission of avian influenza A viruses in mammals [10,11,12,13].Fig. 1Influenza A virion structure. Type A influenza viruses are enveloped viruses that carry eight RNA segments of negative polarity in the form of vRNPs and protected by the matrix protein (M1). Each segment encodes at least one open reading frame. Segment order (1\u20138) and encoded genes for each segment are shown.

Wild aquatic birds\n of the world are considered the natural reservoir of all influenza viruses. There is extensive evidence for transmission of influenza viruses between wild ducks and other species. Two-way transmission events between pigs and humans have been extensively documented and led to the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strainFull size image\nReverse genetic systems for RNA viruses\n\n have been available for many years [14]. For reverse genetics of influenza viruses (Fig. 3), transcription of the mRNA for the viral proteins is typically done from a plasmid encoding a RNA\n                \n               polymerase II (pol II) promoter element upstream of cloned\n\n viral cDNA, and expressed in a manner similar to host mRNA [15]. Synthesis of the negative-sense, single-stranded, uncapped vRNAs can be accomplished by the host\u2019s RNA polymerase I (pol I) [15]. In eukaryotic cells, the RNA pol\n\n\n\n\n                \n                \n               I complex produces uncapped ribosomal RNA. Transcription is terminated with the (murine) RNA polymerase I terminator (T-1), also known as Sal I box, to produce vRNAs with defined start and stop sites, respectively. An alternative method to produce vRNAs is through the use of a T7 RNA\n                \n                \n               polymerase promoter directly upstream of viral cDNA cloned in the negative\n                \n                \n                \n               sense [16]. The 3\u2032 end of the vRNA is formed by the hepatitis delta ribozyme cleavage sequenced cloned immediately downstream. Transcription of the eight vRNAs\n\n\n\n, together with the four protein expression plasmids responsible for viral replication and transcription (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP), allows for the generation of influenza in 293T and a variety of other human derived cell types [17, 18]. Bidirectional vectors have been made that contain pol II and pol I promoters in opposite directions to drive expression of both mRNA\n                \n              \n\n                \n                \n               and vRNA species from the same plasmid, thus consolidating the viral rescue system into eight plasmids [19]. In this chapter, we describe the use of reverse genetic techniques\n                \n                \n               for type A influenza virus using the 8-plasmid system\n\n with bidirectional\n\n promoters as originally described by Hoffman et al. [19]. Minor variations in the procedures compared to those described in the previous chapter are included to teach the reader on the flexibility of the rescue systems. In addition, we provide description on alternative reverse genetics vectors\n\n based on the swine polymerase I (swpol I\n                \n                \n                \n              \n\n                \n                \n                \n              ) and chicken\n\n\n (avian) polymerase I (ckpol I) promoters. Background information regarding each procedure has been kept to a minimum because it is extensively covered in the previous chapter. Please also note that downstream procedures for analysis and characterization of influenza A and B viruses are the same, therefore they are not covered in this chapter.Fig. 3Generation of influenza A virus by plasmid-based reverse genetics\n\n.

To avoid such problem, LB agar plates can be placed inside a biosafety cabinet with the lids open in order to let them air dry.Finally, using a sterile \u201chockey stick\u201d spreader, spread entire SOC\n                    \n                  /cells/ligation suspension on the LB/Ampicillin plate. Place plate in the 37 \u00b0C incubator for 16\u201318 h with the agar side up and the lid side down. The next day, colonies should be visible to the naked eye containing potentially positive clones. A colony PCR reaction can be performed using appropriate set of primers\n to screen for positive clones (Table 1) (see Notes \n9\n and \n10\n).3.5 Colony PCR Screening for Positive RG ClonesSince it is expected for the user to pick several colonies from one or more plates, it is best to prepare a PCR master mix with a volume appropriate for the number of colonies to be screened. Please ignore from the calculation the volume corresponding to the Taq polymerase and the volume corresponding to the colony itself. When preparing a large master mix (\u22655 reactions), mix by vortexing 10 s at medium speed and centrifuge briefly to spin down contents to the bottom of the tube. Maintain master mix on ice. Distribute, in pre-chilled PCR tubes, 20 \u03bcL of PCR master mix/reaction. Add Taq polymerase last, and maintain tubes on ice until ready for PCR reaction.3.5.1 Master Mix\n1.

Keep 1.5 mL tube at 4 \u00b0C to later amplify positive clones, or\n\n\n3.\nShake (do not pipet up or down) tip into 50 mL Falcon tube containing 4\u20135 mL LB/Amp. Use what remains attached on the tip to pipet up and down into a tube containing the PCR cocktail. Keep Falcon tube at 4 \u00b0C to later amplify positive clones, or\n\n\n4.\nMake a replicate of the colony into another plate (place a grid underneath to later identify the positive clones) and use what remains attached on the tip to pipet up and down into a tube containing the PCR cocktail. Incubate grid plate at 37 \u00b0C to let colonies grow again.\nFinally, pipet colony up and down (from one of the four alternatives above) into PCR tubes containing the 20 \u03bcL PCR cocktail, vortex briefly, centrifuge to spin down contents and bring back to ice. Set PCR machine with the following parameters: 94 \u00b0C 5 min, (94 \u00b0C 30 s, 55 \u00b0C 30 s, 72 \u00b0C 5 min) \u00d7 30, 72 \u00b0C 10 min, 4 \u00b0C \u221e. Run PCR.\nOnce PCR reaction is complete, load 5 \u03bcL PCR product on a 1% agarose\n gel with ethidium bromide\n                            \n                           (0.2\u20130.5 \u03bcg/mL) to monitor for presence of clones carrying fragments of expected size. In addition to or instead of colony PCR, positive colonies can also be screened by mini-prep DNA preparation and restriction digestion. A virtual plasmid map of the expected clone, if sequences are known, facilitates the interpretation of screening methods. Regardless of the screening method, positive clones must be sequenced in order to rule out the presence of spurious mutations in either the influenza gene segment or plasmid vector (particularly on promoter regions).\nOnce the appropriate influenza A reverse genetics plasmid\n\n set has been obtained, high-quality plasmid DNA preparations for mammalian transfection are needed. It is recommended the use of endonuclease-free maxiprep DNA kits (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Plasmid DNA concentrations are determined using a NanoDrop\n or similar spectrophotometer\n. Typical pDNA concentrations range from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/mL. We recommend keeping plasmid DNA stocks at \u221270 \u00b0C and preparing working solutions at 100 ng/\u03bcL of each plasmid in order to preserve consistency and to avoid pipetting errors. It is also recommended that prior to each transfection, the integrity of plasmid DNAs be evaluated by agarose\n gel electrophoresis\n\n (see Notes \n11\n and \n12\n).\n\n\n3.6 Generation of Influenza A Virus by Reverse GeneticsThe following procedure has been routinely called \u201cEasy Flu\u201d by Erich Hoffman to highlight the simplicity and efficiency with which influenza A viruses can be recovered by reverse genetics using the 8-plasmid\n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                 system. Using this procedure it is also very easy to cross-contaminate transfection reactions if not careful. Use extreme care when handling cells, transfection reagents, plasmids, and media. The procedure below is described for performing transfections using a 6-well plate format and cocultured HEK293T\n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                /MDCK cells. It is also amenable for scaling down to 12- and 24-well plate formats. And although it is theoretically amenable also for smaller well plate sizes, the smaller the well, the fewer the number of cells susceptible for transfection and the less efficient the recovery of influenza viruses becomes (see Notes \n13\n and \n14\n).HEK293T\n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                 cells and MDCK cells are routinely grown in T75 flasks and maintained as mentioned above in DMEM complete culture media. Prior to working with cells, pre-warm PBS and cell culture media at 37 \u00b0C.3.6.1 Day 1: In a Biosafety Cabinet and at 24 h Prior to Transfection, Freshly Confluent HEK293t and MDCK\n                    \n                   Cells Are Subjected to the Following\n\n\n1.\nWashed once or twice with 5 mL 1\u00d7 PBS or 1\u00d7 medium without FBS.\n\n\n2.\nIncubated with 10 mL trypsin\n-EDTA\n                            \n                           (20\u201345 min for MDCK cells, 1 min for 293T).\n\n\n3.\nCells are removed from the flask using disposable pipettes (with filter), placed in 15 mL conical Falcon tubes, spun down for ~5 min at low speed (800 rpm) in swing bucket centrifuge.\n\n\n4.\nSupernatant is discarded by gently removing it with a serological pipet.\n\n\n5.\nCells are resuspended in 10 mL Opti MEM I, supplemented with 1\u00d7 Antibiotic-Antimycotic\n solution (Opti MEM I-AB\n\n).\n\n\n6.\nRemove 1 mL of each cell line and mix into 18 mL Opti MEM I-AB\n\n and mix well. Tube will now contain ~20 mL of cell suspension. For both experienced and inexperienced investigators, it is best to count cells using a hemocytometer\n prior to seeding on the plate. A HEK293T/MDCK\n                            \n                          \n\n                            \n                            \n                           cell ratio of 1:1\u20135:1 can be used. Consistent virus rescue results are obtained when HEK293T cells are seeded at 4.5 \u00d7 105 cells/well and MDCK cells are seeded at 1.0 \u00d7 105 cells/well in this cocultured format (4.5:1 ratio).\n\n\n7.\nAdd the cell suspension to a 6-well plate\n\n, 3 mL per well.\n\n\n3.6.2 Day 2: The Next Day (16\u201324 h After Cell Seeding), Prepare the Cocktail of Eight Plasmids (One Plasmid per Influenza Viral RNA Gene\n\n Segment) in a 1.5 mL Microcentrifuge Tube. Please Note That the Use of Filter Tips Is Recommended for This and Subsequent Steps to Avoid Potential Contaminations\n\n\n1.\nIf a working stock of each plasmid has been prepared at 100 ng/\u03bcL, pipet 10 \u03bcL of each plasmid (1 \u03bcg of each plasmid, 8 \u03bcg pDNA).\n\n\n2.\nTo the plasmid DNA cocktail, add 20 \u03bcL of Opti MEM I (1:2.5 ratio). Mix well. The tube will now contain ~100 \u03bcL.\n\n\n3.\nIn a separate tube prepare 85 \u03bcL of Opti MEM I and add 16 \u03bcL of TransIT-LT1 (2 \u03bcL/\u03bcg of plasmid DNA). The tube will now contain ~100 \u03bcL. It is easier to calculate the total amount of Opti MEM I/TransIT-LT1 needed for all the transfections and prepare a cocktail with the total volume (plus extra ~10% excess for both).\n\n\n\n4.\nVortex the Opti MEM I/TransIT-LT1\n cocktail and add 100 \u03bcL to the plasmid DNA/Opti MEM I mixture. Mix well. It is essential to change tips to go to the next sample, the system is so sensitive that cross-contaminations will occur if proper care is not taken when handling the samples.\n\n\n\n5.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for approximately 45 min, and then add 800 \u03bcL of OptiMEM I-AB.\n\n\n6.\nRemove the medium from the cells in the 6-wells plate, add the transfection mixture to the cells (t = 0). Incubate the cells for 6\u201312 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C. Washing the cells prior to addition of the transfection mixture is not necessary. Use caution when adding transfection mixture onto the cells. It is best to place the pipet tip as close as possible to the cell monolayer and pipet down dropwise while at the same time preventing the formation of aerosols.\n\n\n7.\nAfter 6\u201312 h transfection, remove the transfection mixture from cells (very slowly), add 1 mL of OptiMEM I-AB to the cells and incubate at 37 \u00b0C until 24 h post-transfection (hpt) in a 5% CO2 incubator. Removal of transfection reaction is best accomplished by tilting the plate slightly towards the user, inserting a pipet tip touching the wall of the well most proximal to the user and pipetting up slowly until most of the medium has been removed. It is not crucial to wash the cells after this step before going into next.\n\n\n8.\nAt 24 hpt, add 2 mL of OptiMEM I-AB containing 1.5 \u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin\n                            \n                              \n                            \n                            \n                           to the cells (1 \u03bcg/mL final concentration).\n\n\n3.6.3 \nDay 3 Onwards (48\u201372 h Post-transfection): Monitor Cells for Cytopathic Effect (CPE), Particularly in the MDCK\n\n\n                    \n                   Cells (See Notes \n13\n and \n14\n).

Details on virus amplification and characterization are extensively covered in Chapter 11 (see Note \n15\n).3.7 Generation of Influenza A Virus by Reverse Genetics Using Alternative Ambisense Plasmid VectorsWhile efficient, the generation of influenza A viruses by a pol I approach is thought to be species specific requiring a species match between the pol I promoter and the cell type [15]. Herein, we describe the procedure to produce influenza A viruses in porcine cell and avian cell types using species specific bidirectional vectors, pPIG2012 and pMACk2009, respectively.The pPIG2012 vector (Fig. 4) is a derivative of pHW2000\n\n in which the 212 nt of the human pol I promoter sequence was replaced with a 168 nt sequence corresponding to the swine pol I promoter. The pPIG2012, like pHW2000, contains two BsmBI\n\n\n\n                  \n                  \n                 sites for cloning\n of full-length cDNA copies of influenza A virus gene segments. Viral segments are amplified and cloned into pPIG2012 in essentially the same manner as described in Hoffmann et al. [11, 16] and before with alternative reverse primers. The pMACk2009 is a derivative of pDP2002 in which the human pol I promoter sequence was replaced with a 415 nt sequence corresponding to the chicken pol I promoter (Fig. 4). A spacer region of 29 nt flanked by AarI\n\n\n\n                  \n                  \n                 sites is removed and replaced with the corresponding full-length cDNA copies of influenza A virus gene segments. Materials and procedures for cloning\n of influenza segments into either pPIG2012 or pMACk2009 are the same as for pDP2002, except that treatment of digested vectors with Shrimp Alkaline\n                  \n                 Phosphatase is recommended to minimize background noise from the vectors\u2019 self-ligation.Influenza A virus reverse genetics rescue using the pPIG2012-based vector is carried out using PK(15) cells, which are routinely maintained in DMEM\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                 supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, and 1\u00d7 antibiotic-antimycotic solution. For virus rescue, PK(15) cells are cocultured with MDCK\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                 cells at a ratio of ~4:1. In a 6-well plates 4 \u00d7 105 PK(15) cells and 1.0 \u00d7 105 MDCK cells are seeded per well. Transfection conditions, precautions, and downstream procedures are as explained above (Subheading 3.6).For influenza virus rescue using the pMACk2009, consistent results are obtained using DF-1 cells. This cells are maintained in DMEM\n\n\n\n                  \n                 supplemented with 10% FBS\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                , 25 mM HEPES, and 1\u00d7 antibiotic-antimycotic\n solution. Since DF-1 cells are sensitive to the action of TPCK\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                -trypsin\n, the reverse genetics procedure is modified from the one described above (Subheading 3.6) as follows:3.7.1 Day 1: DF-1 Cells Are Seeded at 1.5\u20131.8 \u00d7 106 Cells per Well in a 6-Well Seeded 24 h Prior Transfection.

Most institutions require inspections and approvals of laboratories prior to conducting work with infectious disease agents. Prior to engaging in reverse genetics studies with influenza A viruses, consult with pertinent biosafety officials on the type of biocontainment required at your institution.\n\n\n2.\nGeneration of aerosols while working with influenza A viruses must be prevented. Adequately maintain and inspect equipment dedicated to work with influenza A viruses.\n\n\n3.\nOther ambisense/bidirectional\n                        \n                          \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                       plasmids, such as pDZ [17] or pHW2000 [11], can be used for reverse genetics of influenza A viruses with appropriate amplification primers\n.\n\n\n4.\nHEK293T\n                        \n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                       and MDCK cells are also available from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, BEI Resources: NR-9313 (HEK293T) and NR-2628 (MDCK); or from the Influenza Reagent Resource, IRR: FR-241 (HEK293T) and FR-242 (MDCK\n                        \n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                      ). It is important to keep track of cell passage number, particularly for MDCK cells, since it affects influenza A virus growth. The use of late passage cells (above passage 50) is not recommended.\n\n\n5.\nTissue culture media, supplies and reagents and alternative transfection reagents are available through different vendors. Listed above are those that have provided optimal results in our hands.\n\n\n6.\nOther available RNA extraction reagents and methods can also be used, following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.

Synthesis of cDNA can be performed using other reverse transcriptases following manufacturer\u2019s directions. The PCR\n\n amplification step is crucial; the use of other thermophilic DNA polymerase enzymes is possible but those mentioned above have provided the most robust results.\n\n\n7.\n\nPrimers\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                       can be modified based on specific needs. In influenza A viruses, the first 12 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end and last 13 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end of each vRNA segment are highly conserved and the basis for the design of universal (Uni) primers [18,19,20].\n\n\n8.\nLarger viral segments (e.g., PB2, PB1, and PA) are more difficult to amplify because of their length (>2 kb). Consider using more cDNA as a template during the PCR reaction. Alternatively, performing PCR amplification of overlapping fragments of smaller size followed by a second overlapping PCR yields satisfactory results.\n\n\n9.\nIt is not uncommon to find PCR fragments that are difficult to clone into any of the reverse genetics\n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                       vectors. A combination of inefficient restriction enzyme digestion and other inherent properties of the PCR product may in part explain such failures. If that is the case, consider other PCR cloning\n shuttle vectors and proceed with subcloning into the bidirectional rescue plasmid after a suitable candidate has been obtained. For cloning unstable inserts, consider the use of other E. coli strains for improved stability. Alternatively, decreasing temperature (e.g., 30 \u00b0C) helps with the cloning of unstable inserts into the ambisense rescue plasmids.\n\n\n10.\nOther ligation methods can be used following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\n11.\nDigestion of pDP2002 with BsmBI\n\n does not leave compatible ends for self-ligation. However, carry over vector digested at a single site may lead to background noise in the absence of inserts.

{"text": "Reverse Genetics of Influenza B Viruses. \n Abstract \n Annual influenza epidemics are caused not only by influenza A viruses but also by influenza B viruses. Initially established for the generation of recombinant influenza A viruses, plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques have allowed researchers the generation of wild type and mutant viruses from full-length cDNA copies of the influenza viral genome. These reverse genetics approaches have allowed researchers to answer important questions on the biology of influenza viruses by genetically engineering infectious recombinant viruses. This has resulted in a better understanding of the molecular biology of influenza viruses, including both viral and host factors required for genome replication and transcription. With the ability to generate recombinant viruses containing specific mutations in the viral genome, these reverse genetics tools have also allowed the identification of viral and host factors involved in influenza pathogenesis, transmissibility, host-range interactions and restrictions, and virulence. Likewise, reverse genetics techniques have been used for the implementation of inactivated or live-attenuated influenza vaccines and the identification of anti-influenza drugs and their mechanism of antiviral activity. In 2002, these reverse genetics approaches allowed also the recovery of recombinant influenza B viruses entirely from plasmid DNA. In this chapter we describe the cloning\n of influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 viral RNAs into the ambisense pDP-2002 plasmid and the experimental procedures for the successful generation of recombinant influenza B viruses.Key wordsInfluenza B virusPlasmid-based reverse geneticsVirus rescue approachesRecombinant influenza B virusAmbisense plasmids\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDownload protocol PDF\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpringer Nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate Protocols.\u00a0Learn more\n\n\n1 IntroductionInfluenza A and B viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae\n\n                \n                \n                \n              \n\n                \n                \n                \n               family of segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses [1]. Influenza A and B viruses\n                \n                \n                \n              \n\n                \n                \n               are important human pathogens that represent an important public health problem [2]. Influenza A virus has a broad species tropism and mainly exists in the wild aquatic fowl reservoir, whereas influenza B virus is primarily limited and adapted to the human population, although rare infections of seals have also been documented [3, 4]. While both influenza A and B viruses can cause influenza disease and seasonal epidemics, only influenza A viruses have been responsible for pandemics [5, 6]. Currently, only H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A virus, and influenza B virus, are circulating in humans. To date, two major lineages of influenza B viruses can be found infecting humans, the Victoria-like and Yamagata-like strains that are divergent from the ancestral influenza B/Lee/1940 virus, which have been co-circulating in the human population since the 1980s [3, 33, 34]. Though influenza B viruses usually contribute less to epidemics than influenza A viruses of the H3N2 subtype, they contribute more than type A H1N1 influenza strains and are the predominant circulating strain once every 3 years [7,8,9]. Moreover, during the last decade, influenza B virus has been the cause of several acute respiratory illness outbreaks on cruise ships [10, 11], in schools [12,13,14], and within the military [15]; non-respiratory clinical outcomes [9, 16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23], and secondary bacterial pneumonia infections [22, 24, 25]. Influenza B virus health concerns are aggravated by their efficient transmission [26] and the lack of antiviral effectiveness [27]. Both trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) historically consist of three strains of influenza: two subtypes of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) plus one influenza B (Yamagata or Victoria lineages). However, a recent quadrivalent vaccine formulation containing representative strains of influenza B lineages has been implemented [28].Influenza A and B viruses share many features, but they differ in their host range, virion structure, genomic organization, and glycan-binding specificities [23, 29]. The genomes of influenza A and B viruses consist of eight negative-sense, single-stranded RNA segments that share a common organization: a central coding region, sometimes encoding more than one polypeptide, flanked by relatively short untranslated regions (UTRs) [23, 29] (Fig. 1). Despite having similar genomes that encode homologous proteins, influenza A and B viruses can be distinguished by the different lengths of proteins and noncoding regions that serve as promoters for viral genome replication and gene transcription [3, 30, 31]. They can also be distinguished by the presence of accessory proteins encoded from overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) and by the antigenic differences of internal proteins [32]. For instance, influenza A and B viruses both encode ion channel proteins from the M gene (or segment 7), M2 and BM2, respectively. Uniquely, influenza A virus expresses the PB1\u2013F2 pathogenicity factor, and influenza B virus expresses the NB ion channel, which is absent in type A influenza viruses [1]. However, both influenza A and B viruses encode two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin\n                \n               (HA), which is responsible for viral binding and fusion, and neuraminidase (NA)\n, which is necessary for virus release from infected cells (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Influenza B virion structure and plasmid-based\n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                       reverse genetics: Influenza B virus is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing the two viral glycoproteins Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA)\n\n\n                        \n                      , and the ion channel proteins BM2 and NB. HA is the viral attachment protein responsible for binding to sialic acid-containing receptors. NA is responsible for viral release from infected cells. Underneath the lipid bilayer is a protein layer composed of the inner surface envelope matrix protein 1 (M1) which plays a role in virion assembly and budding, and the nuclear exporting protein (NEP) required for nuclear export of the eight viral ribonucleoprotein\n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                       (vRNP) complexes. Influenza B virus contains eight single-stranded, negative-sense, viral (v)RNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA\n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                      , NP, NA, M, and NS) encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (NP). Associated with the eight vRNP complexes are the viral PB2, PB1, and PA polymerase subunits that, together with the viral NP, are involved in viral genome replication and gene transcription (Fig. 2b).

In opposite orientation to the Pol-I cassette, a polymerase II-dependent cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV, white arrow) and a polyadenylation sequence (aBGH, white box) direct the synthesis of influenza B proteins from the same viral cDNA.

Because of influenza A viruses\u2019 pandemic potential [35,36,37], reverse genetics approaches for the generation of recombinant viruses were first established in 1999 for influenza A viruses [38, 39]. Three years later, in 2002, two groups independently reported the successful recovery of influenza B virus\n\n entirely from plasmid DNA [40, 41]. The ability to modify the genome of viruses has revolutionized the influenza research field, allowing specific questions to be answered by genetically engineered, infectious, recombinant viruses [42]. Studies have revealed details of virus genome replication and gene transcription, virulence and pathogenicity, function of viral proteins, virus-host interaction, packaging signals, and host range and transmissibility [31, 32, 42, 43]. Moreover, reverse genetics technologies have also been implemented for the development of influenza virus vaccines [44] and for the generation of recombinant influenza viruses expressing foreign peptides and/or proteins as viral vaccine vectors [45,46,47].In this chapter we describe the experimental procedures for the cloning\n of influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008, which belongs to the B/Victoria lineage, into the ambisense pDP-2002 plasmid for the successful generation of recombinant wild type or mutant viruses upon transfection into susceptible cell lines (Fig. 1).2 Materials2.1 Influenza B VirusThis protocol is described for the rescue of influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus that, like other influenza B virus reverse genetics, can be performed under BSL-2\n\n laboratory conditions (see Note \n1\n).

This bidirectional plasmid contains two transcription units in opposite orientation. The first unit is the human polymerase I (hPol-I\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                ) promoter and a murine Pol-I transcription terminator (TI) for the expression of influenza B vRNAs\n\n. Expression from the hPol-I cassette generates vRNAs without additional nucleotides at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 end of the viral genome that are recognized by the influenza B viral NP and polymerase complex\n\n (PB2, PB1, and PA) for viral genome replication (cRNA) and gene transcription (mRNA\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                ) (Fig. 2b). The second unit is the polymerase II-driven cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (aBGH\n                  \n                ) to express mRNAs (Fig. 2b). The use of this combined RNA Pol-I/II approach allows vRNA and mRNA syntheses from the same vector, eliminating the need for separate vRNA and mRNA\n                  \n                 plasmids and, therefore, reducing the number of plasmids to eight for the efficient rescue of influenza B viruses [32, 42] (see Note \n4\n). Influenza B viral cDNAs\n                  \n                  \n                 are cloned into the pDP-2002 plasmid using two BsmBI restriction sites located between both transcription cassettes (Fig. 2a). The bidirectional\n                  \n                    \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                 pDP-2002 plasmid contains a spacer sequence of 444 nucleotides between the two BsmBI\n\n restriction sites that can be used to monitor BsmBI digestion efficiency using agarose\n gel electrophoresis\n\n.Plasmids are prepared using commercially available plasmid preparation kits, following the manufacture\u2019s recommendations. We suggest storing the plasmids at \u221220 \u00b0C at a concentration of 1.0\u20130.5 mg/mL. This significantly simplifies the procedure to generate recombinant influenza B wild type or mutant viruses since 1\u20132 \u03bcL, respectively, of each plasmid is then used for viral rescue (see Note \n5\n).2.7 Mammalian Cell Lines for the Generation of Recombinant Influenza B Viruses\n\n\n1.\nHuman embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T\n                          \n                          \n                        ) cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, CRL-11268) (see Note \n6\n): A derivative of 293 cells containing the temperature-sensitive Simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen [49].

HEK293T\n                          \n                          \n                         cells have been shown to have high transfection efficiency and thus, optimal for initial amplification of influenza B vRNAs from ambisense plasmids [40, 41]. Although highly transfectable, HEK293T cells\n                          \n                          \n                         are not ideal for influenza B virus replication.\n\n\n2.\nMadin-Darby\n                          \n                         canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) (see Note \n6\n): This cell line is less optimal for transfection than HEK293T\n                          \n                          \n                         cells. Moreover, because of the species specificity of the Pol-I promoters [50, 51], transfection of MDCK cells with the eight influenza B pDP-2002 ambisense plasmids will not result in the initial amplification of vRNAs. However, MDCK cells are the best cell line for influenza B virus replication, producing high viral titers [52].\n\n\nBoth cell lines are maintained with DMEM\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                 10% FBS, 1% PSG at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere tissue culture humidified incubator.

Eggs can be incubated at 37 \u00b0C before virus rescue but at 33 \u00b0C for amplification, propagation, and growth of influenza B virus.\nAll procedures to infect and harvest the allantoic fluid\n of chicken embryonated eggs are performed under sterile conditions. Always, dispose infected eggs in biosafety autoclavable bags and autoclave following IBC recommendations.\nVerify the viability of the embryos before and after viral infection by candling the eggs (see Note \n7\n). Prior to harvesting the allantoic fluid, incubate the eggs for at least 2 h (preferably overnight) at 4 \u00b0C to kill the chicken embryo and coagulate the blood. Alternatively, incubate eggs at \u221220 \u00b0C for 30 min before harvesting. Approximately 8\u201310 mL of allantoic fluid can be harvested from 8\u201310-day-old chicken embryonated eggs.\nIn some instances, it is difficult to obtain chicken embryonated eggs for rescue or amplification of influenza B virus.

Therefore it is recommended to wear gloves and work using sterile conditions during the extraction and manipulation of RNA. We also recommend keeping the sample(s) on ice throughout the entire RNA extraction procedure to avoid RNA degradation. In addition, it is recommended to always use sterile, disposable plasticware and use pipettes which are dedicated only for RNA handling.\n\n1.\n\nvRNAs\n\n are extracted using TRIzol\n                          \n                            \n                          \n                          \n                          \n                          \n                         reagent (Invitrogen), RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), or any other available RNA extraction method following procedures recommended by the manufacturer (see Note \n10\n).

Incubate for 16\u201318 h in a 37 \u00b0C shaking (200 rpm) incubator (see Note \n27\n).\n\n\n7.\nAfter overnight incubation, purify the plasmid DNA using a miniprep kit (Qiagen), following the manufacture\u2019s recommendations (see Note \n29\n). Analyze the purified plasmid DNAs by restriction analysis and agarose\n gel electrophoresis\n\n\n\n                          \n                          \n                         (see Notes \n30\n and \n31\n). Alternatively, selected clones can be initially screened by colony PCR to determine the presence or absence of insert DNA into pDP-2002 before sequencing. If the digested pDP-2002 plasmids contain the expected influenza B viral segments, confirm their nucleotide composition by sequencing (see Note \n32\n).\n\n\n8.\nOnce the pDP-2002 plasmids\n                          \n                        \n\n                          \n                          \n                         have been confirmed by sequencing and shown not to contain mutations, make high-quality plasmid DNA preparations for mammalian transfection. Inoculate positive clones in 2 mL of LB liquid media containing 100 \u03bcg/mL of ampicillin and grow them at 37 \u00b0C for 8 h (see Note \n27\n). Transfer the 2 mL bacteria solution to 250\u2013500 mL of LB liquid media containing 100 \u03bcg/mL of ampicillin and grow at 37 \u00b0C for 16\u201318 h (see Note \n27\n). Extract plasmid DNA using a maxiprep DNA kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (see Notes \n29\n, \n33\n, and 34). Determine plasmid DNA concentration using a NanoDrop\n or similar spectrophotometer\n. We recommend evaluating the quality and quantity of the purified plasmid also by restriction digestion and agarose\n\n\n                          \n                          \n                         gel electrophoresis (see Notes \n5\n, \n30\n, and 31).\n\n\n3.5 Transfection of Mammalian Cells for the Generation of Recombinant Influenza B Virus from Cloned\n\n cDNAsOverall, rescue of recombinant influenza B viruses using plasmid DNA is a simple process. However, there are some key factors for a successful recovery of influenza B viruses using plasmid\n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                -based reverse genetics techniques: (1) good preparations of pDP-2002 plasmids, (2) proper maintenance of the HEK293T and MDCK\n                  \n                 cell lines, and (3) high DNA plasmid\n                  \n                  \n                 transfection efficiencies.To increase the likelihood of successful influenza B virus\n\n rescue, we recommend three independent transfections. If more than one recombinant influenza B virus rescue is attempted, scale the following steps accordantly to the number of viruses to be rescued. The following transfection and infection protocol is established for 6-well\n\n\n\n                  \n                  \n                 plates. A schematic representation of the protocol to generate recombinant influenza B viruses is illustrated in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Generation of recombinant influenza B\n                          \n                          \n                         virus using plasmid-based reverse genetics: The eight influenza B pDP-2002 \n\n\n\n                          \n                        ambisense plasmids (1 \u03bcg/plasmid) are transiently co-transfected in suspension, using LPF2000, into co-cultures of canine MDCK and human HEK293T cells (day 1, plasmid NDA transfection). Twenty-four hours after, transfection media is replaced by infection media (see Note \n43\n) containing TPCK-treated trypsin\n (day 2, media change). Two days after, tissue culture supernatants are collected and used to infect fresh monolayers of MDCK\n                          \n                        \n\n                          \n                          \n                         cells or 8\u201310-day-old chicken embryonated eggs (day 4, virus amplification). Three days after virus amplification\n                          \n                        , tissue culture supernatants from MDCK cells or allantoic fluid\n\n\n                          \n                         from eggs are collected and examined for presence of influenza B virus using a hemagglutination (HA) assay (day 7, virus detection). If influenza B virus is not detected or detected at low titers, virus can be amplified by re-passaging the tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluid from eggs into fresh MDCK cells and/or embryonated eggs (virus amplification).

Due to the species specificity of the RNA Pol-I promoter [50, 51], only cells from primate origin with high transfection efficiency, like HEK293T cells\n                          \n                        \n\n                          \n                        \n\n                          \n                        , can be used for virus rescue (see Notes \n37\n and \n38\n). On the other hand, MDCK cells support the growth of many influenza viruses [52], including influenza B, and therefore are co-cultured with HEK293T cells\n                          \n                          \n                         for efficient viral rescues. Usually, one confluent 100 mm dish of each cell line (HEK293T and MDCK\n                          \n                        \n\n                          \n                          \n                         cells) can be used for approximately 10\u201312 viral rescues.\n\n(a)\nWash the cell monolayers twice with 4 mL of PBS 1\u00d7. Remove the last PBS 1\u00d7 wash and add, slowly, 1 mL of a 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 5\u201310 min until cells detach from the 100 mm dish plates (see Note \n39\n).\n\n\n(b)\nCarefully resuspend individually each cell line in 10 mL of cell culture media and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.

Determine the concentration of the MDCK cells using a hemocytometer\n. Mix equal volumes of HEK293T and MDCK cells, based on the number of transfections, in a separate tube (see Note \n41\n). This will give you the mixture of HEK293T and MDCK cells to be used for transfection (see Note \n42\n).\n\n\n\n\n5.\nAfter 20\u201330 min incubation at room temperature, add to each of the OptiMEM I-LPF2000-plasmid DNA transfection\n\n\n\n                          \n                          \n                        \n\n                          \n                         tubes (step 3) 1 mL of the HEK293T/MDCK cell co-culture and incubate for 5\u201310 min at room temperature.\n\n\n6.\nAdd the 1.3 mL (step 6) into individual wells in a 6-well tissue culture plate.\n\n\n7.\nGently shake the 6-well plate\n\n and let the transfection incubate for 6 h or overnight in the 33 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 humidified tissue culture incubator.\n\n\n8.\nAfter 6 h incubation (or the next day), change the transfection media for postinfection media containing 0.5 \u03bcg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin\n and incubate for 48 h at 33 \u00b0C (Fig. 3) (see Notes \n43\n and \n44\n).\n\n\n9.\nAfter 48 h incubation, collect the tissue culture supernatants into microcentrifuge\n\n tubes and centrifuge\n\n for 1\u20132 min at 13,000 \u00d7 g to remove cells and cell debris.

Transfer the tissue culture supernatants to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature to remove cells and cell debris. Collect the supernatants to fresh Eppendorf tubes and store them at 4 \u00b0C (short-term storage) or at \u221280 \u00b0C (long-term storage) (see Note \n47\n).\n\n\n\n\n10.2\n\u2002Infection of 8\u201310-day-old chicken\n                          \n                          \n                         embryonated eggs:\nAll procedures to infect chicken embryonated eggs are performed under sterile conditions [42]. Before and after infection, it is very important to look for dead eggs, by candled them, before and after infection [42]. Before infection, a dead egg can be easily spotted by the absence of blood vessels as well as the absence of embryo mobility [42]. After viral infection, a dead egg will be easily identified by a bloody and smaller volume of allantoic fluid\n [42].\n\n(a)\nCandle the 8\u201310-day-old chicken embryonated eggs using an egg candler and mark the inoculation site at the interphase between the allantoic\n                                  \n                                 cavity and the air sac.

Alternatively, incubate eggs at \u221220 \u00b0C for 30 min before harvesting.\n\n\n(f)\nWash the eggshells with 75% ethanol\n                                  \n                                 to establish sterile conditions and open the egg, carefully, over the air cavity by tapping with a spoon.\n\n\n(g)\nRemove the broken eggshell with the help of forceps.\n\n\n(h)\nUsing a 1 mL needle, remove the allantoic membrane without breaking the egg\u2019s yolk.\n\n\n(i)\nCollect as much allantoic fluid\n as possible from each egg, without breaking or collecting any of the egg\u2019s yolk, with a sterile 10 mL plastic pipette. Transfer the allantoic fluid into a 15 mL centrifuge tube on ice (see Note \n48\n). Use individual 15 mL centrifuge tubes for each egg.\n\n\n(j)\nCentrifuge (200 \u00d7 g) for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to pellet any egg-derived red blood cells and transfer the clear allantoic fluid\n to a fresh 15 mL centrifuge tubes on ice.\n\n\n(k)\nAllantoic fluid\n                                  \n                                  \n                                 can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for a short period of time until evaluating the presence of rescued virus (see Subheading 3.6). Once the presence of virus in tissue culture supernatants or in the allantoic fluid\n of chicken embryonated eggs has been assessed, make aliquots the virus and place them at \u221280 \u00b0C for long-term storage (see Note \n47\n). Virus titer can be determined as described in Subheading 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Methods for the Detection of Influenza B Rescued VirusThere are multiple direct and indirect methods for detecting and quantifying the presence of influenza B virus in tissue culture supernatants from MDCK cells or allantoic fluid\n from chicken embryonated eggs. All methods have unique advantages and disadvantages (not discussed here), and we focus on four typically used techniques (Fig. 4). Once an assay identifies the presence of rescued virus, the virus should be plaque purified and the genetic composition of the virus\n\n will need to be confirmed by RT-PCR\n                  \n                 and sequencing.Fig. 4Detection of influenza B virus. (a) Hemagglutination (HA\n                          \n                        ) assay: Presence of influenza B virus from tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluid\n from chicken embryonated eggs (Fig. 3) is evaluated by hemagglutination of turkey or chicken red blood cells\n                          \n                            \n                            \n                          \n                          \n                          \n                         (RBCs) macroscopically: absence of influenza B virus results in the formation of a red pellet (line 3) while presence of virus results in hemagglutination of RBCs (lines 1 and 2). (b) Immunofluorescence (IF) assay: IF assays are widely used for the rapid detection and quantification of influenza B\n                          \n                         virus infections in tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluid from chicken embryonated eggs (Fig. 3), by determining the presence of virus antigens using specific antibodies. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells (96-well plates, 4 \u00d7 105 cells/well) mock infected (top panel) and infected for 8\u201310 h with a series of influenza B virus dilutions (bottom panel, only a dilution example) are fixed, permeabilized, and stained with influenza B virus-specific antibodies and secondary fluorescein-conjugated antibodies. Presence of influenza B virus is determined by the presence of fluorescent positive cells.

(c) Plaque assay: Plaque assays can be used to demonstrate the presence of rescued influenza B virus and/or to accurately determine the number of virus (plaque forming units, PFUs) from MDCK\n                          \n                        \n\n                          \n                          \n                         tissue culture supernatants of from the allantoic fluid of chicken embryonated eggs (Fig. 3). Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells (6-well plate format, 106 cells/well) are infected with tenfold serial dilutions (starting dilution of \u22122) of tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluids. After 1 h viral absorption at room temperature, cell monolayers are overlaid with agar-containing medium. Influenza B virus plaques are visible at 48\u201372 h postinfection after staining with crystal violet\n. (d) Tissue culture\n                          \n                         infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay: TCID50 is the tissue culture dilution dose required to infect 50% of monolayers of MDCK cells (96-well plate format, 4 \u00d7 105 cells/well). As shown in the figure, MDCK cells mock infected (top row) or infected (triplicates) with tenfold serial dilutions (starting dilution of \u22121) of tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluids are evaluated 3\u20134 days postinfection for the presence of CPE using an inverted microscope and by staining with crystal violet. Influenza B viral titers are calculated based on the method of Reed and Muench [56]. For more details, see main textFull size image\n3.6.1 Hemagglutination (HA)\n                    \n                   AssayThis method is routinely used to detect the presence of rescued influenza B viruses in tissue culture supernatants from MDCK cells and/or the allantoic fluid\n from chicken embryonated eggs. We recommend performing, first, a hemagglutination (HA) assay since it takes approximately 30\u201360 min and it will provide information on the presence or absence of virus. In the case of influenza B virus, approximately 104 plaque forming units (PFUs) are required to give a positive signal in the HA\n                    \n                   assay. Therefore, other assays more sensitive than the HA assay (e.g., plaque, immunofluorescence\n                    \n                  \n\n                    \n                  , or TCID50 assays) should be performed to confirm a true negative result. Presence of virus induces hemagglutination\n                    \n                      \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                   of turkey and/or chicken red blood cells (RBCs), while the absence of virus allows the formation of a red pellet in the bottom of the well (Fig. 4a). If virus is not detected using an HA assay because of low viral titers, a new passage of virus-containing samples in fresh MDCK cells or 8\u201310-day-old embryonated chicken eggs will allow amplification of the rescued virus (Fig. 3). Tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluids from this second passage should now be positive in the HA assay\n                    \n                  . It is important to include virus-containing tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluids as a positive control of the HA assay. Likewise, mock-infected tissue culture supernatants, allantoic fluids, or PBS 1\u00d7 should be included as negative control to validate the HA assay.\n\n(a)\nDispense 50 \u03bcL of PBS 1\u00d7 into each well of a V-bottom 96-well plate\n.\n\n\n(b)\nAdd 50 \u03bcL of the tissue culture supernatants from MDKC cells or allantoic fluid\n from chicken embryonated eggs to the first well of the V-bottom 96-well plate, and make twofold serial dilutions (50 \u03bcL) for the following wells. Discard the extra 50 \u03bcL from the last well.\n\n\n(c)\nAdd 50 \u03bcL of 0.5\u20131.0% turkey\n                            \n                              \n                              \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                           or chicken RBCs\n                            \n                           (prepared in PBS 1\u00d7) to each well of the V-bottom 96-well plate (see Note \n49\n).\n\n\n(d)\nIncubate the V-bottom 96-well plate\n\n for 30\u201345 min on ice, until a red dot is visible in the bottom of the negative control sample.\n\n\n(e)\nRead and interpret the results as shown in Fig. 4a.\n\n\n3.6.2 Immunofluo-rescence (IF\n                    \n                  ) AssayThis method is recommended, after performing an HA\n                    \n                   assay, to validate the identification of influenza B virus from tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluid\n of chicken embryonated eggs due to the time (approximately 8\u201310 h) and sensitivity of the assay. IF assays can detect the presence of individual influenza B viruses in samples, thus it is possible that tissue culture supernatants from MDCK\n                    \n                  \n\n                    \n                   cells or allantoic fluids from chicken embryonated eggs could be negative in the HA assay (less than 104 PFU) yet positive in the IF assay. Direct IF assays use fluorescent-tagged anti-influenza B monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (not discussed here) while indirect IF approaches require the use of unlabeled anti-influenza B monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. Like for the HA assay, include negative and positive controls to validate the IF assay (see Note \n50\n). All cell-based assays for the detection of influenza B virus (e.g., IFA, plaque, and TCID50\n\n                    \n                  \n\n                    \n                   assays) are recommended to be performed in MDCK cells.\n\n(a)\nSeed approximately 2.0 \u00d7 104 MDCK\n                            \n                            \n                           cells/well, using a multichannel pipette, in 96-well plates the day before the infection to reach confluence (4 \u00d7 104 cell/well) after 1 day.\n\n\n(b)\nBefore infection, check the cells under a light microscope to confirm the presence of a cell monolayer.\n\n\n(c)\nMake tenfold serial dilutions of the virus sample in PBS 1% BSA\n                            \n                           using a multichannel pipette. Starting with the most diluted sample, add 50 \u03bcL of the virus dilution to each of the wells in the 96-well plate with the multichannel pipette (see Note \n51\n).\n\n\n(d)\nInfect for 1 h at room temperature.\n\n\n(e)\nAfter 1 h of viral absorption, remove the virus inoculum and add 100 \u03bcL of postinfection media containing 1 \u03bcg/mL of TPCK\n                            \n                          -treated trypsin\n                            \n                          \n\n                            \n                           with the multichannel pipette.\n\n\n(f)\nPlace the plates at 33 \u00b0C in the 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 8\u201310 h (see Note \n52\n).\n\n\n(g)\nRemove the infectious media from the 96-well plates and add 100 \u03bcL/well of the fix/permeabilization solution with the multichannel pipette. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\n\n\n(h)\nRemove the fix/permeabilization solution and wash once with 100 \u03bcL/well of PBS 1\u00d7, using the multichannel pipette.\n\n\n(i)\nIncubate the cells with blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature (see Note \n53\n).\n\n\n(j)\nDilute the primary unlabeled anti-influenza B monoclonal or polyclonal antibody in blocking solution (see Note \n54\n). Add sufficient antibody to completely cover the cell monolayer to prevent drying (~100 \u03bcL/well). Incubate for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C.\n\n\n(k)\nCarefully remove the primary antibody and wash the cells with 100 \u03bcL/well of PBS 1\u00d7 three times using the multichannel pipette.\n\n\n(l)\nDilute the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody in blocking solution to a predetermined optimum working dilution. Add sufficient secondary antibody to completely cover the cell monolayer to prevent from drying (~100 \u03bcL/well). Incubate for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C.\n\n\n(m)\nCarefully remove the secondary antibody and wash the cells with PBS 1\u00d7 three times with the multichannel pipette (see Note \n55\n). Remove the last PBS 1\u00d7 wash and add 100 \u03bcL of PBS 1\u00d7.\n\n\n(n)\nEvaluate the number of infected cells using a fluorescent microscope\n                            \n                           (Fig. 4d) and calculate the viral titer in focus forming units per milliliter (FFU/mL) using the following formula: FFU/mL = number of positive fluorescent cells \u00d7 virus dilution \u00d7 1/volume of inoculum (mL).\n\n\n3.6.3 Plaque AssayThis procedure is a direct quantitative measurement of the number of infectious viruses\n                    \n                    \n                   in tissue culture supernatants from MDCK cells or allantoic fluid\n\n\n                    \n                   from chicken embryonated eggs [54]. A semisolid overlay is placed over the MDCK cell monolayer to prevent the virus from infecting cells others than neighboring cells. Each arising plaque will have originated from a single virus. After 2\u20133 days postinfection, the cell monolayer is stained with 0.5% crystal violet\n to visualize the plaques for quantification [44]. Presence of virus will lyse the cells and will result in the formation of a white plaque surrounded by a stained cell monolayer.\n\n(a)\nThe day before infection, seed approximately 5 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, to reach confluence (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) the next day.\n\n\n(b)\nBefore infection, check the cells under a light microscope to confirm the presence of a cell monolayer.\n\n\n(c)\nMake tenfold serial dilutions of the virus sample in PBS 1% BSA\n                            \n                          . Starting with the most diluted sample, add 500 \u03bcL of the virus dilution to each of the wells. Be careful not to track the pipette tip over the well, which could result in destroying the cell monolayer.\n\n\n(d)\nInfect the cells for 1 h at room temperature, gently rocking the plates back and forth every 10 min by hand to prevent the cells from drying.\n\n\n(e)\nDuring this incubation time, prepare the DMEM-F12 containing agar. Microwave the solution of agar for approximately 1\u20132 min and equilibrate at 42 \u00b0C in a water bath for 10 min. Mix the rest of the components of the DMEM-F12 media containing 1 \u03bcg/mL of TPCK\n                            \n                          \n\n                            \n                            \n                          -treated trypsin\n and warm them at 37 \u00b0C in a water bath. Mix the DMEM-F12 media with the equilibrated agar and gently add 2 mL to each of the wells in the 6-well plate. Let the plate(s) sit for 15 min at room temperature, as the agar overlay solidifies.\n\n\n(f)\nIncubate the 6-well plate(s) at 33 \u00b0C in the 5% CO2 humidified incubator in an inverted position to avoid condensation on the overlay agar.\n\n\n(g)\nWhen viral plaques are visible (approximately 2\u20133 days), fix the plates with a solution of 2.5% formaldehyde in PBS 1\u00d7 for 30 min at room temperature (or overnight). Carefully remove the overlay media and subsequently add 1 mL of 0.5% crystal violet\n solution to each well. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\n\n\n(h)\nRemove the crystal violet\n solution and wash the cells with ddH2O\n                            \n                            \n                          . Allow the plates to air-dry before counting the number of virus plaques.\n\n\n(i)\nCount the plaques in the lowest two dilutions with visual plaques and calculate the viral titer in PFU/mL using the following formula: PFU/mL = number of plaques \u00d7 virus dilution \u00d7 1/volume of inoculum (mL). An example of a plaque\n\n assay result is shown in Fig. 4c.\n\n\n3.6.4 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose\n                    \n                   50 (TCID50) AssayThis procedure can be performed to determine the presence of virus and/or to titer the amount of virus from tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluid\n [55]. It is based on the ability of influenza B virus to cause CPE in monolayers of MDCK cells (Fig. 4d) [41]. We recommend performing the TCID50 assay in triplicate (see Note \n51\n). Similar to the previous assays, we recommend including positive and negative controls to validate the TCID50 test.\n\n(a)\nThe day prior to infection, seed approximately 2.0 \u00d7 104 MDCK\n                            \n                           cells/well in 96-well plates\n\n\n\n                            \n                           using a multichannel pipette in DMEM 10% FBS\n                            \n                          \n\n                            \n                          , 1% PSG to reach confluence the day of infection.\n\n\n(b)\nBefore infection, check the cells under a light microscope to confirm the presence of a cell monolayer.\n\n\n(c)\nOn the day of infection, make tenfold serial dilutions of the virus sample (tissue culture supernatants or allantoic fluid\n) in infection media using a multichannel pipette.\n\n\n(d)\nStarting with the most dilute sample, add 50 \u03bcL of the virus dilutions to each of the triplicate wells using the multichannel pipette. Be careful not to track the pipette tip over the well, which could result in destroying the cell monolayer.\n\n\n(e)\nInfect for 1 h at room temperature.\n\n\n(f)\nAfter 1 h of viral absorption, remove the virus inoculum and add 100 \u03bcL of postinfection media containing 1 \u03bcg/mL of TPCK\n                            \n                          -treated trypsin\n.\n\n\n(g)\nPlace the 96-well tissue \n                            \n                            \n                          culture plates at 33 \u00b0C in the 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\n\n\n(h)\nAt 3\u20134 days postinfection, monitor CPE under a light microscope. Remove media and stain with 100 \u03bcL of the 0.5% crystal violet\n solution for 20 min at room temperature.\n\n\n(i)\nRemove the crystal violet\n solution, wash the plates with ddH2O, and let them dry at room temperature.\n\n\n(j)\nCalculate the TCID50\n\n                            \n                           using the method of Reed and Muench [56]. An example of a plaque assay result is shown in Fig. 4d.\n\n\n3.7 Amplification of Influenza B Virus and Production of Virus StocksAs indicated above, it is possible that tissue culture supernatants from MDCK\n                  \n                 cells and/or allantoic fluid\n from chicken embryonated eggs contain low viral titers due to suboptimal transfection efficiencies, plasmid preparations or maintenance of the HEK293T and/or MDCK cells. In this case, influenza B virus should be amplified by infecting fresh monolayers of MDCK\n                  \n                  \n                 cells or the allantoic fluid of 8\u201310-day-old chicken embryonated cells (Fig. 3). Likewise, MDCK cells or 8\u201310-day-old chicken embryonated eggs should be used to generate influenza B virus stocks. Amplification of influenza B virus in MDCK cells or the allantoic fluid of chicken embryonated eggs follows the same protocol as described in Subheading 3.5, step 10. We recommend infecting MDCK cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 or chicken embryonated eggs with 102\u2013103 PFUs and incubate them at 33 \u00b0C for 2\u20133 days. We also recommend storing the collected virus in small volume aliquots (0.1\u20130.2 mL) for long-term storage at \u221280 \u00b0C (see Note \n47\n).3.8 Identification of Recombinant Influenza B Virus Generated by Reverse GeneticsAs described before, we usually include a genomic tag in one of the influenza B viral segments for easy identification of the recombinant virus. Recombinant viruses should be plaque purified and after amplification\n\n\n\n                  \n                  \n                \n\n                  \n                  \n                , RT-PCR and sequencing approaches should be performed to verify the recombinant nature of the rescued virus. Likewise, recombinant influenza B viruses containing mutations should be verified by RT-PCR and sequencing analyses (see Note \n56\n).4 Notes\n\n\n1.\nAlthough in this chapter we describe plasmid-based\n\n reverse genetics for the generation of recombinant influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 viruses [31], this protocol can be used for the recovery of other recombinant influenza B\n\n viruses.\n\n\n2.\nOther available RNA extraction reagents and methods can also be used, following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\n3.\nOther agaroses\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                       can also be used for DNA gel electrophoresis.\n\n\n4.\nAlternatively, other ambisense plasmids, such as pDZ [57] or pHW2000\n\n [48], can be used for efficient influenza B virus rescues\n\n.\n\n\n5.\nPlasmid preparation is one of the key factors for efficient influenza B virus rescues. We recommend having clean (a 260/280 ratio of >1.8 as determined by Nanodrop\n or similar spectrophotometer\n) plasmid preparations for successful attempts. Plasmid stocks at 1.0\u20130.5 mg/mL facilitate the generation of recombinant influenza B viruses since same volume (e.g., 1\u20132 \u03bcL, respectively) of the different ambisense plasmids is used for transfection of mammalian cells.\n\n\n6.\nHEK293T\n                        \n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                       and MDCK cells are also available from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, BEI Resources: NR-9313 (HEK293T) and NR-2628 (MDCK); or from the Influenza Reagent Resource, IRR: FR-241 (HEK293T) and FR-242 (MDCK). It is important to keep track of the cell passage number, particularly for MDCK cells, since it can affect influenza B virus rescue efficiency and virus propagation. The use of late passage cells (above passage 50) is not recommended.\n\n\n7.\nViability of chick embryos can be determined before viral infection because live embryos move when candled.

Moreover, it is also recommended to use small volumes of water for the final reconstitution of RNA. Always use sterile, disposable plasticware and pipettes that are dedicated only to RNA handling, and RNase-free (ThermoFisher)\n\n\n\n                        \n                          \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                       or DEPC-treated ddH2O.\n\n\n11.\nMeasure DNA and RNA concentrations at an absorbance of 260 nm. The 260/280 ratio is a good estimate of how pure is the sample is; a 1.8\u20132.0 ratio is optimal for RNA and DNA plasmid preparations. If the 260/280 ratio is lower, samples may be contaminated with proteins or other impurities.\n\n\n12.\nOthers available reverse transcriptase enzymes can also be used, following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\n13.\nFor the amplification of other influenza B cDNAs, primers\n may be different.\n\n\n14.\nWhen using another DNA polymerase, please refer to the respective manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\n15.\nFor influenza B virus\n                        \n                        \n                      , the nucleotide sequences at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of each vRNA segment are completely conserved [1, 58]. These noncoding region sequences, which are specific for each vRNA segment [1], represent the viral promoters for positive and negative RNA synthesis [1]. For influenza B virus, the last 10 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end and the last 9 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end are highly conserved, with the exception of position 6 (A/T) in the 3\u2032 end [3, 32]. Thus, it is possible to amplify the entire genome of different influenza B viruses using universal primers.\n\n\n16.\n\nBsmBI\n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                       (CGTCTCN 1/5) belongs to type II restriction endonucleases that recognize asymmetric sequences and cleave these sequences at a defined distance. For cloning\n, use of this type II restriction endonuclease causes the respective restriction sites to disappear. This leaves the Pol-I promoter and terminator sequences to provide the exact 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, respectively, of each vRNA that is required for efficient influenza B viral rescues.\n\n\n17.\nBsmBI restriction sites are uncommon and therefore, not usually present in influenza B vRNA sequences. If an influenza B vRNA\n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                       segment presents a BsmBI\n\n site, this can be still used for cloning\n into the pDP-2002. In this case, the viral cDNA should be first cloned into a shuttle vector (such as the pGEM-T vector series, Promega) and then subcloned into the pDP-2002 vector using partial digestion. If the BsmBI restriction site(s) are too close to the cDNA ends, they can be still cloned in the pDP-2002 vector by digestion with BsmBI using a multiple segment ligation protocol because the BsmBI site leaves four-nucleotide overhangs that will differ from each other. To avoid multiple cloning steps, it is possible to design a pair of universal primers for the specific influenza B vRNA segments to be cloned, in which the BsmBI cloning site is replaced with another restriction endonucleases (e.g., AarI\n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                      , BbsI, or BsaI) that cuts outside its recognition site similarly to BsmBI.\n\n\n18.\nLarger viral segments (e.g., PB2, PB1, and PA) are more difficult to amplify because of their length. If that is the case, consider using more cDNA as a template during the PCR reaction. Alternatively, use the initial PCR product in a second PCR reaction to amplify the full-length viral polymerase segments.\n\n\n19.\n\npDP-2002\n\n contains the hRNA Pol-I promoter sequence. Due to the species specificity of the RNA Pol-I promoters, human cells are required for virus rescue\n\n. We recommend the use of HEK293T\n                        \n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                        \n                       cells because of their high transfection efficiency for successful viral rescue [42]. Other reverse genetics systems based on promoters derived from other avian [59] or canine [60, 61] species have also been established for the rescue of influenza viruses.\n\n\n20.\nIncreased efficiency can be achieved adding more enzyme during the digestion at 55 \u00b0C. Thus, after 2 h incubation, add 1 \u03bcL of BsmBI\n\n and incubate the digestion mixture for an additional hour at 55 \u00b0C. Alternatively, incubate BsmBI digestions overnight for efficient DNA digestion.\n\n\n21.\n\npDP-2002\n\n has an extra 444 nucleotides between the BsmBI restriction sites to verify BsmBI digestion. Thus, bands with a size of approximately 450 and 2950 nucleotides should be visible upon BsmBI digestion of pDP-2002. Contrary to the situation with pDP-2002, it is not possible to evaluate whether or not the influenza B cDNAs have been digested with BsmBI. Thus, the influenza B cDNAs can be first cloned into a shuttle vector such as pGEM-T (Promega) and subcloned into the pDP-2002 by BsmBI digestion.\n\n\n22.\nDigestion of pDP-2002 with BsmBI does not leave compatible ends for religation. However, we recommend treating the BsmBI-digested pDP-2002 plasmid\n                        \n                       with SAP in case any pDP-2002 plasmids have been digested only at one of the BsmBI restriction sites.\n\n\n23.\nAlternatively, the Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche) can be used for ligation of pDP-2002 and the influenza B cDNAs.\n\n\n24.\nOther E. coli-competent cells\n\n can be used for plasmid transformation\n.\n\n\n25.\nOther media such as Luria-Broth\n                        \n                        \n                      \n\n                        \n                       (LB) or Super Optimal Broth (SOB) can be used to grow bacteria-competent cells during plasmids transformation.\n\n\n26.\npDP-2002 has ampicillin\n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                       resistance.

To reduce the number of unwanted mutations, use high-fidelity RT and PCR kits and, always, sequence the entire cDNA to detect undesired mutations.\n\n\n33.\nIt is important to not cross-contaminate plasmid preparations. Carefully manipulate bacteria and plasmid DNA preparations to avoid unwanted bacteria and/or plasmid contaminations.\n\n\n34.\n34 Generate a glycerol\n stock of the bacteria cultures with the correct plasmids for long-term storage and to prevent further transformation of bacteria competent cells.

{"text": "Alternative reverse genetics system for influenza viruses based on a synthesized swine 45S rRNA promoter. \n AbstractWe generated an alternative reverse genetics (RG) system based on a synthesized swine 45S rRNA promoter to rescue the H3N2 subtype swine influenza virus. All eight flanking segment cassettes of A/swine/Henan/7/2010 (H3N2) were amplified with ambisense expression elements from RG plasmids. All segments were then recombined with the pHC2014 vector, which contained the synthesized swine 45S rRNA promoter (spol1) and its terminal sequence (t1) in a pcDNA3 backbone. As a result, we obtained a set of RG plasmids carrying the corresponding eight-segment cassettes. We efficiently generated the H3N2 virus after transfection into 293T/PK15, PK15, and 293T cells. The efficiency of spol1-driven influenza virus rescue in PK15 cells was similar to that in 293T cells by titration using the human pol1 RG system. Our approach suggests that an alternative spol1-based RG system can produce influenza viruses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking on a manuscript?\nAvoid the common mistakes\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductionDe novo synthesis of influenza viruses by reverse genetics (RG) requires both viral RNA (vRNA) transcripts and protein components [1\u20134]. The truncated human polymerase I promoter (hpol1) driven RG system that is based on twelve or eight plasmids has been widely used to rescue influenza viruses [4, 5]. Thus, RG systems for influenza virus rely invariably on a dual promoter concept: one to synthesize the vRNA segments and the other to synthesize the viral mRNAs [1]. As the termini of influenza vRNAs are crucial for virus replication, plasmids carrying truncated pol1 or t7pol have been used to generate vRNAs with the exact 5\u2032 end, whereas pol1 terminator sequences (t1) or a hepatitis \u2202 ribozyme site has been used to generate the exact 3\u2032 end. Plasmids carry typical pol2 promoters (CMV and/or chicken \u03b2-actin promoters) and the polyA region bovine growth factor (\u03b1BGH), while the polyA tail is used to synthesize influenza mRNAs for viral proteins [5\u20139]. Bi-directional RG plasmids carrying all segments have been co-transfected into human embryo kidney (HEK)-293T cells to generate influenza viruses. However, 293T cells are actually not permitted to produce vaccine seeds, as a certified cell line must lack tumorigenicity and adventitious infectious agents to produce a cell-based Influenza vaccines [10]. Only a few mammalian cell lines are permitted to produce influenza vaccines, including porcine kidney PK-15 cell line, Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells [11, 12]. However, the MDCK cell line cannot produce viruses because of the inefficiency of hpol1 in canine cells, except for some mutated MDCK cell strains [7, 13]. On the other hand, the Vero cell line does not transfect well nor support high efficiency virus rescue when compared to 293T cells [14].Some modifications have been used to improve vaccine generation in mammalian cells, one of which is to construct degenerated plasmids [15, 16]. Our previous study successfully improved the efficiency of using Gateway cloning strategy to subclone all essential elements from an eight-plasmid RG system using several candidates as donor vectors [17]. Another way to improve RG efficiency in licensed cell lines is to replace the RNA pol1, for which the polymerase from mice [18], chickens [16], horses [19], dogs [13], and monkeys [14] have been used to construct RG systems. These modified RG systems can efficiently rescue viruses, with the isolates of influenza viruses in different hosts being rescued in its host cells, thus avoiding adaptation mistakes when viruses are generated in 293T or MDCK cells. Until now, no progress has been made on the swine pol1, even though many isolates have been rescued from swine using the human RG system. In this report, we constructed an alternative RG system based on the swine 45S rRNA promoter (spol1), which can be used to rescue influenza viruses.Materials and methodsViruses and cellsWe chose an H3N2 subtype swine influenza virus called A/swine/Henan/7/2010 (H3N2) (HN07) as the viral system; the strain was isolated from a Henan swine farm in 2010. This virus grew very well in MDCK and porcine kidney PK-15 cells, and obtained a mean titer of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 TCID50/ml, which facilitated\u00a0the calculation of rescue efficiency from the virus production. MDCK and PK-15 cells were maintained in Modified Eagle\u2019s medium (MEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). The virus stocks were prepared in MDCK cells following standard techniques for growing influenza viruses [20]. HEK-293T cells were cultured in Opti-MEM I (Gibco) containing 5% FBS.Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)The vRNAs and cDNAs from the HN07 virus were prepared as described previously [8]. All viral segments were amplified from viral cDNAs. Briefly, total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out with the Uni12 primer (5\u2032-AGCAAAAGCAAGG-3\u2032) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The cDNAs were stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until needed.Subcloning using an in vitro recombination approachWe subcloned the spol1 element into a pMD18-T vector, henceforth designated pT18-spol1. The vector had an absent CMV promoter to produce the mRNA of genes of interest. In this report, the gfp gene flanking the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and 5\u2032 UTR of the M segment from the PR8 virus was amplified with the pHW72-GFP vector (a gift from Dr. Daniel R. Perez, University of Georgia) and subcloned into pT18-spol1 at the BsmBI sites. The recombinant vector was named pT18spol1-GFP and was similar to the pHW72-GFP plasmid, which is typically used as a reporter system for the testing of viral polymerase efficiency in previous studies [20].The recombinant cloning strategy of the RG eight-plasmid system for the HN07 virus has been described previously [17]. The segments were amplified with the primers shown in Table\u00a01, and subcloned into pHC2014 using a rapid restriction enzyme-free Exnase\u2122 II-based in vitro recombination approach from our previous study [21]. The recombinant RG plasmids were designated pHC-PB2, pHC-PB1, pHC-PA, pHC-HA, pHC-NP, pHC-NA, pHC-M, and pHC-NS. The segments were also subcloned into the pDP2002 bi-directional RG plasmid (a gift from Dr. Daniel R. Perez) to compare the rescue efficiency of the hpol1-based RG system with that of the spol1-driven RG system. The recombinant RG plasmids were designated pDP-PB2, pDP-PB1, pDP-PA, pDP-HA, pHC-NP, pDP-NA, pDP-M, and pDP-NS.Table\u00a01 Universal primers for swine RG systemFull size table\nGeneration of swine virus by reverse geneticsThe corresponding virus rescue was performed as described previously with minor modifications [8]. Co-cultured 293T/MDCK or 293T/PK15 cells at a ratio of 50:1 (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells/well) were seeded into each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate. The plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. The following day, media were replaced with fresh serum-free Opti-MEM, after which 1\u00a0\u00b5g of each plasmid was incubated for 45\u00a0min with 16\u00a0\u00b5l of TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI, USA). At 24\u00a0h post-transfection (hpt), l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin was added to the cell supernatants (1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml for 293T/MDCK and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml for 293T/PK15). MDCK and PK15 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 75-cm2 flasks, trypsinized with trypsin\u2013EDTA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and resuspended in MEM containing 5% FBS. Cell suspensions were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight before infection. Infection and post-infection steps proceeded as described for the 293T/MDCK (coTM) or 293T/PK15 (coTP) co-cultured cells above, and the PK-15 cells were incubated with 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml of TPCK-trypsin. Supernatants of transfected or infected cells were collected and then frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until titration. The virus titers were determined as TCID50/ml in MDCK cells using the Reed and Muench method [22].Sequence analysisThe PCR products for all eight segments of the HN07 wild-type virus as well as the rescued viruses were sequenced using the Sanger method, with a combination of universal primers from the GENEWIZ company [8]. Sequence analyses were performed using a software available from the Lasergene 10 package (DNAstar Inc., Madison, WI, USA).Statistical analysesAll data were plotted and statistically analyzed using the Prism 6 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). The mean of the two groups were compared with a two-tailed Student t test, whereas multiple comparisons were carried out by an analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA method). The differences were considered statistically significant at p values of <0.01 or <0.05.ResultsTo construct the basic bi-directional vector for RG, we synthesized a potential promoter sequence flanking the NheI site upstream of the mouse t1 terminal sequence and the BstEII site downstream of the \u03b1BGH polyA tail. We then subcloned the sequence into the pDP2002 vector to replace hpol1 with spol1. After Sanger sequencing, the plasmid was designated pHC2014.To obtain the eight-plasmid RG systems for the HN07 virus, the segments were subcloned into pHC2014 by a rapid restriction enzyme-free Exnase\u2122 II-based in vitro recombination approach used in our previous study [21]. The recombinant RG plasmids were pHC-PB2, pHC-PB1, pHC-PA, pHC-HA, pHC-NP, pHC-NA, pHC-M, and pHC-NS. The segments were also subcloned into the pDP2002 bi-directional RG plasmid to compare the rescue efficiency of the hpol1-based RG system with that of the spol1-driven RG system. The recombinant RG plasmids were designated as pDP-PB2, pDP-PB1, pDP-PA, pDP-HA, pHC-NP, pDP-NA, pDP-M, and pDP-NS.To determine the efficiencies of the pHC2014 vector and the RG plasmids, we introduced GFP as a rescue reporter. The results showed that GFP expression was driven by viral polymerases and the spol1 promoter after transfection with the pT18spol1-GFP reporter and plasmids pHC-PB2, pHC-PB1, pHC-PA, and pHC-NP in 293T cells. The pT18spol1-GFP reporter system worked well compared with a high ratio of positive cells expressing the pHW72-GFP reporter plasmid that had a slightly lower efficiency (Fig.\u00a01A).Fig.\u00a01Efficiency of the reverse genetics (RG) systems to rescue H3N2 subtype swine influenza virus. A Efficiency of the GFP reporter system. The results of transfection with the pT18spol1-GFP reporter and the pHC-PB2, pHC-PB1, pHC-PA, and pHC-NP plasmids into 293T cells showed that GFP expression could be driven by viral polymerases and the spol1 promoter (b). Compared to the high ratio of positive cells expressing the pHW72-GFP reporter (a), the pT18spol1-GFP reporter system works well and was slightly lower.

Both RG systems were useful to rescue this swine H3N2 virus efficiently. In triplicate experiments, the mean titer of transfectants for the hpol1-based RG system was 5.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 TCID50/ml at 96\u00a0h post-transfection (hpt), while the titer for spol1 driven RG system was 200-fold less (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). C Rescue efficiency of the RG system in PK-15 cells. In triplicate experiments, the highest efficiency at 96 hpt in 293T/PK-15 co-culture was the hpol1-coTP group with a mean titer of 1.58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0TCID50/ml. The spol1-coTP virus titer was 200-fold less (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Rescue efficiency was much lower in PK15 cells only, but remained positive. No difference in virus amount was detected between the spol1-PK15 and hpol1-PK15 virusesFull size image\nTo identify whether the virus rescue worked in PK-15 cells, the hpol1-based RG plasmids or spol1-based RG plasmids were transfected into 293T/PK-15 co-culture or PK-15 cells, respectively. The results showed that both RG systems could be used to rescue the swine H3N2 virus efficiently. The mean transfectant titer for the hpol1 based RG system was 5.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 TCID50/ml at 96 hpt, which was greater than a 200-fold increase to that of the spol1 driven RG system (Fig.\u00a01B). The highest efficiency was observed in the hpol1-coTP group at 96 hpt in a 293T/PK-15 co-culture, with a mean titer of 1.58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0TCID50/ml, which was also upwards of a 200-fold increase to that of the spol1-coTP virus. The rescue efficiency was much lower in PK-15 cells only at 96 hpt, while no differences in virus amount was detected between spol1-PK15 and hpol1-PK15 viruses (Fig.\u00a01C). The rescued viruses were sequenced to confirm the identity and then titered to determine appropriate virus amounts. After passage into MDCK or PK15 cells, we found a similar amplification with the rescued viruses at 72\u00a0h post-infection (supplementary Fig.\u00a01).DiscussionIn most eukaryotes, the RNA pol1 promoter sequence and regulatory elements are located in the intergenic spacers between the 28S and 18S rRNA coding sequences of the 45S rRNA. The transcription initiation site of the RNA pol1 promoter is located upstream of the 18S rRNA and is 3000\u20135000\u00a0bp long [23]. A potential spol1 promoter is located within 540\u2013742\u00a0bp of the 45S rRNA gene (Genbank accession no. L31782.1) in Sus scrofa. The synthesized spol1 has a SalI box with the common sequence \u201cGGTTGACCAGA,\u201d a distal conserved sequence and a proximal conserved sequence compared to canine and human pol1, respectively.In our previous study, we showed partial and full PCR-based RG strategies for an influenza virus driven by hpol1 or canine pol1 (k9pol1). Although rescue efficiency was quite low in Vero and MDCK cells, the approach is a fast-alternative method to produce vaccine candidates for human pandemic influenza [20]. Most recently, we constructed all-in-one bacmids driven by hpol1 using Gateway cloning technology, which were used to overcome some of the limitations of cloning full influenza virus RG sets into a single DNA unit constrained by stability or copy number. bcmd-RGFlu constructs succeeded in improving transfection efficiency (100-fold) compared to the eight-plasmid counterparts, particularly in hard-to-transfect Vero cells [17]. In this report, we initially tried to develop a modified RG system based on the spol1 promoter, which was supposed to have higher efficiency. However, compared to the efficiency of an RG system based on the hpol1 promoter, the spol1-RG system showed a moderate efficiency (Figs.\u00a01, S1), which could be developed into an alternative reverse genetics system for influenza virus rescue.The primary hypothesis of this RG system was to avoid host range by swine strains. A key point to evaluate influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission is the appropriate choice of animal hosts or cell supports. Elucidation of the in vitro infection mechanisms depends on a reliable and continuous porcine cell line. To avoid adaptive mutagenesis, in vitro amplification was performed to determine the interaction between swine influenza virus and a cell line from the original host that yielded optimal virus replication and fitness. Since then, some swine cells have been used to replace MDCK or human cells, such as the SD-PJEC cells that are particularly suitable to study the pathogenic mechanism of influenza virus infections that are of swine origin [24]. In this report, PK15 cells were used for virus rescue. Both pol1 promoters were shown to be functional in PK15 cells (Fig.\u00a01C). We are presently utilizing this RG system to rescue more swine influenza viruses for confirmation, including the pandemic H1N1 2009 swine virus and H1N2 subtype or H3N2 swine isolates. The deep-sequencing method will be used to compare wild-type virus with the rescued viruses from 293T/MDCK or PK-15 cells. These results would need to be supported through further studies.In summary, we demonstrated an alternative technology to generate influenza viruses. Compared to the human pol1-based RG system, the efficiency of spol1-driven influenza virus rescue in PK15 cells was quite similar to that in 293T cells by titration. Our approach suggests that an alternative spol1-based RG system can produce influenza viruses."}
{"text": "Efficient generation of recombinant influenza A viruses employing a new approach to overcome the genetic instability of HA segments. \n Abstract \n Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are the most relevant and continual source of severe infectious respiratory complications in humans and different animal species, especially poultry. Therefore, an efficient vaccination that elicits protective and neutralizing antibodies against the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) is an important strategy to counter annual epidemics or occasional pandemics. With the help of plasmid-based reverse genetics technology, it is possible that IAV vaccine strains (IVVS) are rapidly generated. However, the genetic instability of some cloned HA-cDNAs after transformation into competent bacteria represents a major obstacle. Herein, we report efficient cloning strategies of different genetically volatile HA segments (H5- and H9-subtypes) employing either a newly constructed vector for reverse genetics (pMKPccdB) or by the use of the Escherichia coli strain HB101. Both approaches represent improved and generalizable strategies to establish functional reverse genetics systems preventing genetic changes to the cloned (HA) segments of IAV facilitating more efficient rescue of recombinant IAV for basic research and vaccine development.\n\nCitation: Mostafa A, Kanrai P, Petersen H, Ibrahim S, Rautenschlein S, Pleschka S (2015) Efficient Generation of Recombinant Influenza A Viruses Employing a New Approach to Overcome the Genetic Instability of HA Segments.

Out of these three genera, influenza A viruses (IAV) are the most likely to cause serious infections in different species including humans [2]. IAV is composed of eight negative sense genomic RNA segments within a lipid-bilayer envelope. According to the antigenicity of the two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), IAV can be subtyped into 18 HA subtypes and 11 NA [3\u20137].\nAvian IAVs affect not only poultry industries, but are also potential threats to human health [8]. In recent years, many avian and porcine IAV have crossed the host barrier resulting in sometimes fatal infections of humans, such as the pandemic swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) H1N1 in 2009, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) H7N9 and H10N8 [9\u201312]. For these reasons, rapid development of new or adjusted influenza virus vaccine strains (IVVS) is an important and efficient tool to protect both human and poultry against potential health- and economic threats. Here the development of, plasmid-based reverse genetics (RG) systems to generate IAV from cloned cDNA represents a major improvement [13\u201315]. The respective RNA-segments encoding HA- and NA, against which protective antibodies are being generated after infection/vaccination, can now be cloned into RG vectors and are then transfected into cells together with six additional RG plasmids encoding the remaining genome segments of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, H1N1), which replicates to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs, allowing high yields of the respective IVVS [7,16,17] Ultimately, RG permits the rapid generation of recombinant IVVS with a desired genome composition to reduce the impact or even protect against influenza epidemics and pandemics [18\u201321]. However, eventual genetic instability of plasmids encoding HA or the NA-segments in Escherichia coli (E. coli) represents a major obstacle on the way to generate candidate IVVS.\nAlthough plasmids use different systems/mechanisms to keep their genetic stability in E. coli, the instability of plasmids can be induced either by the random expression of toxic gene products, presence of AT-rich sequences, the plasmid copy number (low or high), secondary and tertiary structures, genotype of the competent cells as well as the presence of long repeats and promoters [22\u201328]. In E. coli, the multi-functional RecA protein is essential for most homologous recombination and repairing of the double-stranded DNA breaks [29,30]. To limit or inhibit the recombination of the transformed DNA with the E. coli genome, the RecA gene of different bacterial strains was mutated to generate different recA alleles (e.g. recA1, recA13 and recA\u2212) [31,32]. Moreover, a low cultivation temperature and plasmids with a low copy origin of replication were also reported to be beneficial to maintain high plasmid stability [33\u201335].\nRecently, the instability of plasmids encoding IAV genomic segments was reported for the PB2 segment of A/Turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9) when cloned into common cloning plasmids like pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen, USA) or established RG plasmids like pHH21 [14] using different competent bacterial strains (recA1, recA13 and recA or recB deficient), temperatures (25\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C) and antibiotic concentrations [36]. Here, we demonstrate how we overcame such difficulties in cloning the HA-cDNAs of two avian IAV from different subtypes, H9N2 (H9N2/SA, A/chicken/Saudia Arabia/CP7/98) and H5N1 (H5N1/VSVRI, A/chicken/Egypt/VSVRI/2009).\nThe genetic instability of the cDNA encoding HA segments of the mentioned strains in standard RG plasmids pHW2000 [37] and pHH21 was detected when regularly used E. coli strains were transformed (e.g. DH5\u03b1 and Top10). Nevertheless, we could stably clone the HA-cDNAs by two different approaches: (1) by transformation of the HA-cDNAs cloned into the standard RG vector pHW2000 into the recA13 E. coli strain HB101 and (2) by cloning the unstable HA-cDNAs into the improved RG vector, pMKPccdB, followed by transforming the plasmid DNA into the commonly used competent E. coli strains like DH5\u03b1 and XL1-blue. These two approaches permitted us to generate prototype IVVS with the HA and NA of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI. For this, the HA- and NA-encoding plasmids based either on pHW2000 or pMKPccdB were transfected together with pHW2000 plasmids encoding the remaining six internal genome segments of PR8. Both IVVS generated by these approaches showed comparable replication efficiency. We thereby demonstrate that these two cloning strategies provide a powerful tool to prevent genetic instability of cloned viral segments and simplify the generation of complete reverse genetics systems and vaccine strains for influenza A viruses.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCells, viruses and viral cDNA\nMadin-Darby canine- and human embryonic kidney cells, MDCK-II and 293T, were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 100 I.U./ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. Virus stock of the influenza virus A/chicken/Saudi Arabia/CP7/1998 (H9N2/SA) was obtained by inoculation of 100 \u03bcl (100 FFU) through allantoic route into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. After 48 h incubation at 37\u00b0C in an egg incubator (Heka, Germany), eggs were chilled at 4\u00b0C overnight. The allantoic fluid was then harvested and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris. The cDNA for A/chicken/Egypt/VSVRI/2009 (H5N1/VSVRI) was obtained from the Egyptian Veterinary Serum and Vaccine Research Institute (VSVRI).\n\n\nFull-length RT-PCR amplification of HA and NA segments\nThe viral RNA of the H9N2/SA virus was extracted using \u201cRNeasy Protect Kit\u201d (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The HA and NA segments of H9N2/SA were then amplified in separate reactions using \u201cSuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR Platinum Taq High Fidelity\u201d (Invitrogen, USA). Briefly, 5\u03bcl of extracted vRNA was mixed with 25\u03bcl \u201c2\u00d7 Reaction Mix\u201d, 2\u03bcl (0.4 \u03bcM each) of the Blunt-Ba-HA-F and Blunt-Ba-HA-R primers for the HA segment (Table 1) or universal primers [38] with BsmBI restriction sites for the NA segment (Table 1) of H9N2/SA and 1 \u03bcl of enzyme mix. The total volume was adjusted to 50 \u03bcl using nuclease-free water (Ambion, USA) and subjected to cDNA synthesis at 55\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by pre-denaturation (94\u00b0C for 2 min), PCR amplification (35 cycles: 94\u00b0C/15 sec for denaturation, 58\u00b0C/30 sec for annealing and 68\u00b0C/3 min for extension) and final extension (1 cycle: 68\u00b0C/7 min). For H5N1/VSVRI, the cDNA generated using the Uni-12 primer [38] was used as a template. The mutibasic cleavage site (PQGEGRRKKR/GLF) in the H5/VSVRI was converted to a monobasic cleavage site (PQGETR/GLF) by amplifying the HA1 and HA2 separately using specific primers (Table 1). However, the NA segment of H5N1/VSVRI was amplified also using the universal primers [38] with BsmBI restriction sites (Table 1). Briefly, 2 \u03bcl cDNA were mixed with 5 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 PCR Buffer, 1 \u03bcl 10mM dNTP mixture (0.2 mM each), 1.5 \u03bcl of 50 mM MgCl2 (1.5 mM), 2 \u03bcl of each Primer (40 pmoles) and 0.2 \u03bcl of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (10 U/\u03bcl) (Invitrogen, USA). The total volume was adjusted to 50 \u03bcl using nuclease-free water (Ambion, USA), followed by pre-denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, PCR amplification (35 cycles: 94\u00b0C/30 sec for denaturation, 58\u00b0C/30 sec for annealing and 68\u00b0C/3 min for extension), then final extension at 68\u00b0C/7 min. The PCR products were purified using \u201cGeneJET Gel Extraction Kit\u201d (Thermo Scientific, USA). The obtained RT-PCR fragments were next digested with BsaI and BsmBI for according to manufacturer protocol to be used further cloning.\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageTable 1.  Primers used for the amplification of monobasic HA and the NA segments of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI.\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116917.t001\n\nGeneration of chimeric HA plasmids\nIn an attempt to circumvent the observed instability of the H9N2/SA-HA sequence, which we suspected to be located in the HA2-part, plasmids encoding chimeric HAs were generated by exchanging the HA1 sequence of the pHW2000 plasmid (pHW-HA-Bei) stably encoding the A/Chicken/Beijing/2/1997 (H9N2/Bei) HA with the corresponding sequence from the pSMART-LC-Kan plasmid (pSMART-HA-SA) possessing the HA-cDNA of A/chicken/Saudi Arabia/CP7/1998 (H9N2/SA) and vice versa. For this the HA1 sequences of pHW-HA-Bei and pSMART-HA-SA were excised using \u201cFastDigest\u201d AlwNI and EcoRI (Thermo Scientific, USA) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and the HA1 sequence of the H9N2/Bei was cloned into pSMART-HA-SA, while the HA1 sequence of H9N2/SA was cloned into pHW-HA-Bei. To assure that plasmids to express the chimeric HAs have the same vector backbone the chimeric HA-cDNA in pSMART-HA-Bei/SA containing the HA1 of the H9N2/Bei-HA and HA2 of the H9N2/SA-HA was subcloned into pHW2000 after excision using BsaI-HF for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and ligation into BsmBI pre-cut pHW2000 using T4 ligase (Thermo Scientific, USA) at 22\u00b0C for 1 h. The resulting two pHW2000 plasmids (pHW-HA-Bei/SA, pHW-HA-SA/Bei) with the chimeric HAs (S1 Fig.) were transformed into competent XL-1 blue E. coli and analyzed for correct positive transformants.\n\n\nConstruction of pMKPccdB vector\nTo generate pMKPccdB vector with BsaI, BsmBI or AarI cloning/restriction sites, Pol-I/ccdB/Pol-II cassettes containing the three different cloning/restriction sites were transferred from the respective pMPccdB vector versions [39] using \u201cFastDigest\u201d BsrBI enzyme (Thermo Scientific, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The gel-purified cassettes were ligated into the EcoRV-blunt ends of pSMART-LC-Kan vector using T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific, USA) according to the manufacture instructions. The ligation reactions were then transformed into \u201cOne Shot ccdB Survival 2 T1R\u201d competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacture instructions and cultured on LB agar plates. 16\u201318 h later, five individual colonies were picked up and cultured for 18 h at 37\u00b0C in 5 ml of LB media containing 30 \u03bcg/ml of Kanamycin (SERVA, Germany) followed by plasmid DNA extraction using mi-Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Metabion, Germany). The bacterial culture containing the correct plasmid DNA construct, confirmed by enzymatic digestion and sequencing, was subjected to large scale culture (250 ml LB media) and plasmid DNA extraction/purification using NucleoBond Xtra Maxi (Macherry-Nagel, Germany).\n\n\nSite directed mutagenesis\nTo silently mutate all BsaI- and BsmBI-recognition sites in the backbone of pMKPccdB, \u201cQuickchange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit\u201d (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used as previously described [40]. The mutated forward and reverse primers (Table 2) were designed using PrimerX software package (http://www.bioinformatics.org/primerx/). Briefly, 1 \u03bcl of template plasmid DNA (2 ng) was mixed with 0.5 \u03bcl of each forward and reverse primer (2.5 pmoles/\u03bcl), 0.25 \u03bcl of 40 mM dNTP mix (10 mM each), 1.25\u03bcl \u201c10\u00d7 Pfu Ultra Buffer\u201d and 0.25 \u03bcl of \u201cPfu Ultra Hotstart polymerase enzyme\u201d. The total volume was finally adjusted to 12.5 \u03bcl with nuclease-free water (Ambion, USA). The reaction was kept at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 18 cycles of 50 sec at 95\u00b0C for denaturation, 50 sec at 60\u00b0C for primer annealing and 5 min at 68\u00b0C for extension. The final extension was held at 68\u00b0C for 7 min. After the PCR program was finished, 0.25 \u03bcl of DpnI (20 U/\u03bcl) was added directly to the reaction and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min to digest the methylated and hemi-methylated parental strands. An aliquot of 2 \u03bcl of the final reaction was transformed into 20 \u03bcl \u201cOne Shot ccdB Survival 2 T1R\u201d competent E. coli cells\u201d. The correct clones were confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing of the extracted plasmid DNA.\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageTable 2.

The pCR2.1 constructs carrying the cloned NA-segments, proved by enzymatic digestion and subsequent sequencing, were digested by \u201cFastDigest\u201d BsmBI enzyme (Thermo Scientific, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, and then the NA-cDNAs were ligated into BsmBI-linearized pHW2000 using T4 ligase (Thermo Scientific, USA). The ligation reactions were transformed into DH5-alpha (New England Biolabs, USA) according to manufacture instructions.\nSince the cloned HA-segments of H9N2/SA showed instability in the genetic backbone of pCR2.1 sequencing vector, the full-length RT-PCR products of HA segments amplified with primers containing EcoRV and BsaI sites were digested with EcoRV enzyme (Thermo Scientific, USA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to produce blunt-ends to allow the ligation into the EcoRV-linearized pSMART-LC-Kan (Lucigen, USA). The positive and correct vector/insert constructs were digested with BsaI-HF (NEB, Germany) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. The digested product was then purified using \u201cQIAquick PCR Purification Kit\u201d (Qiagen, Germany). Meanwhile, the pHH21, pHW2000, pMPccdB and pMKPccdB were linearized with the \u201cFastDigest\u201d BsmBI (Thermo Scientific, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The linearized vectors were then purified using \u201cGeneJET Gel Extraction Kit\u201d (Thermo Scientific, USA) and ligated to BsaI-sticky ends of the amplified cDNAs using T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific, USA) according to the manufacture instructions. The ligation products were transformed into Top10 (Invitrogen, USA), DH5-alpha (New England Biolabs, USA), DH10B (Invitrogen, USA), XL1-Blue (Stratagene, USA), Stbl2 (Invitrogen, USA), Sure (Stratagene, USA), Stbl3 (Invitrogen, USA), Stbl4 (Invitrogen, USA) and HB101 (Promega, USA) competent cells at different temperatures (25, 30 and 37\u00b0C) and various antibiotic concentrations (25, 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml for ampicillin or 15 and 30 \u03bcg/ml for kanamycin). The extracted DNA of overnight individually propagated 5 colonies in LB media for each bacterial strain, temperature condition and RG system were analyzed using enzymatic digestion and sequencing.\n\n\nChloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) assay\nTo analyze quantitatively the polymerase II activity (mRNA synthesis) of pMKPccdB in comparison with pHW2000, the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex of influenza virus A/Hamburg/04/09(Hamburg/H1N1) was reconstituted in vitro using the according PB1 segment cloned either into pMKPccdB or pHW2000. Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of pMKPccdB or pHW2000 plasmids encoding the PB1 segment of Hamburg/H1N1 together with 2 \u03bcg pPOLI-CAT-RT [15] and 1 \u03bcg of pHW-PB2, 1 \u03bcg of pHW-PA and 2 \u03bcg of pHW-NP of Hamburg/H1N1 were transfected into 80-90% confluent monolayer of 293T cells using 2 \u03bcl \u201cTrans-IT2020\u201d (Mirus, USA)/1 \u03bcg DNA [15,41,42]. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and then the cell extracts were prepared and tested for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity (1:10 dilution) as described previously [15].\n\n\nWestern blot analysis\nConfluent 293T cells seeded in a 6-well plate, were transfected in triplicates with 2 \u03bcg plasmid DNA/well of pHW2000 and pMKPccdB plasmids encoding the HA segment of H5N1/VSVRI (pHW-H5 HA/VSVRI and pMKP-H5 HA/VSVRI, respectively). Trans-IT2020\u201d (Mirus, USA) was us as a transfection reagent as previously described above in \u201cChloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) assay\u201d. After 24 h, cells were lysed as previously described [43]. Cell lysates were separated on precast gradient NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels (Invitrogen, Germany) and transferred onto Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck Millipore, Germany) AT 150 Volts/cm2. Following protein transfer, PVDF membranes were blocked using blocking buffer (1\u00d7 TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl) containing 5% non-fat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The membranes were washed 1 time using washing buffer (1\u00d7 TBS-Tween: TBS containing 0.05% Tween20). Afterwards, detection of viral HA protein and cellular beta actin was achieved using primary mouse anti-influenza A virus (H5N1/HA1) monoclonal antibody (abcam, England) and rabbit anti-beta Actin monoclonal antibody (abcam, England) diluted in blocking buffer at a dilution of 1:5000 and 1:10000, respectively. One hour later, the membranes were washed for 3 times with washing buffer and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680 (1:10000 in blocking buffer containing SDS (1:1000 dilution of a 10% stock solution)), and added to the membranes in the dark for 1 h. After 3 times washing with washing buffer and one time with 1\u00d7 TBS, the proteins were visualized using an \u201cOdyssey Infrared Imaging System\u201d and the according application software package (LI-COR, Germany). To quantify the amount of the protein, basic \u201cQuantity One\u201d software was used (Bio-Rad, Germany).\n\n\nTransfection and rescue of recombinant viruses\nTo generate the different prototype IVVS, 1 \u03bcg of each pHW2000- or pMKPccdB plasmid encoding HA and NA segments of H9N2/SA or H5N1/VSVRI together with pHW2000 plasmids encoding the remaining segments of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, H1N1) were co-transfected into a co-culture of 293T/MDCK-II cells (ratio 3:1, 10 cm2) as previously described with minor modifications [14,39,44]. Briefly, the transfection mixture consisting of 180 \u03bcl \u201cOpti-MEM\u201d (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA) and 8 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA (1 \u03bcg of each plasmid) along with 16 \u03bcl \u201cTrans-IT2020\u201d (Mirus, USA) were incubated for 45 min at RT. The transfection mixture was then diluted to 1 ml using Opti-MEM and transferred to 80\u201390% confluent cell monolayer to allow transfection. The cells were then incubated for 8 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. The transfection medium was replaced with 1 ml of infection medium composed of \u201cOpti-MEM\u201d containing 100 I.U./ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 0.2% BSA (PAA, Germany) and the cell cultures were incubated for another 12 h. Afterwards, an additional 1 ml of infection medium containing 2 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin was added (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The cell culture supernatant was harvested 48 h after addition of the TPCK-treated trypsin and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5min at 4\u00b0C. An aliquot of 500 \u03bcl of each supernatant was used for the inoculation of fresh MDCK-II cells (25 cm2) and the cultures were then incubated for 72 h in the presence of TPCK-treated trypsin (1 \u03bcg/ml). To detect and characterize the recovered viruses, standard HA assay as well as RT-PCR using subtype-specific HA primers was performed (primers not shown). The titration of the recombinant viruses was performed using foci assay as described previously [45].\n\n\nVirus growth curves\nTo investigate the growth kinetic of the prototype IVVS expressing HA and NA of H5N1/VSVRI and H9N2/SA that were either generated using pMKPccdB or pHW2000 reverse genetic systems, confluent monolayers of MDCK-II cells (3.5 cm dishes) were infected in triplicates with an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for 1 h at RT to allow virus adsorption. Unabsorbed virus was removed by washing the cells with 1\u00d7 PBS++. Then, 2 ml infection medium (1\u00d7 DMEM containing 100 I.U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 0.2% BSA and 1 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin) was added. An aliquot of 200 \u03bcl from the supernatant was collected and replaced with 200 \u03bcl of fresh infection medium at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post-infection (p.i.). Aliquots collected from the different viruses were then titrated using standard hemagglutinin assay and focus assay [45,46].\n\n\nResults\n\nInstability of cloned HA-cDNA of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI\nTo generate the IVVS, the cDNA of HA and NA segments of the candidate strain have to be precisely and correctly cloned into a suitable reverse genetic (RG) system. Herein, the NA-cDNAs of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI were cloned into pCR2.1 for sequencing and further sub-cloning into the standard RG vector pHW2000. Both HA-cDNAs of H9N2/SA- and H5N1/VSRVI cloned in the backbone of pCR2.1showed genetic alterations. Upon transformation of DH5-alpha at 37\u00b0C none of the transformants contained the correct vector/insert construct as demonstrated by the enzymatic digestion (data not shown). Furthermore, repeated trials to transform pCR2.1 constructs with the respective HA-cDNAs into different E. coli strains (Top10, DH10B, XL1-Blue, Sure, Stbl2 and Stbl4) failed to obtain the correct plasmid constructs at both the standard temperature of 37\u00b0C and at lowered temperatures of 30 and 25\u00b0C and different antibiotic concentrations (25, 50 and 100\u03bcg/ml ampicillin). However, all transformants analyzed contained the correct vector/insert DNA when the same cDNAs were cloned into the cloning vector pSMART-LC-Kan. Therefore, the insert DNA of these positive clones carrying the HA-cDNA of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI in pSMART-LC-Kan, confirmed by enzymatic digestion and sequencing, were subsequently sub-cloned into the RG vectors pHW2000 [44], pMPccdB [39] and pHH21 [14] and transformed into different competent bacterial strains (Top10, DH5-alpha, DH10B, XL1-Blue, Sure, Stbl2, Stbl3 and Stbl4), propagated at different temperatures (25, 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C) and antibiotic concentrations (25, 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin). To our surprise, both sub-cloned HA-cDNAs were unstable again under these conditions in the different vectors and bacterial strains. The enzymatic digestion of different constructs encoding both cDNAs did not match the expected pattern (data not shown). Although, a few clones of pHW2000, pMPccdB and pHH21 carrying the HA-cDNA of H9N2/SA were demonstrated positive by enzymatic digestion, the sequencing results showed that they were not functional due to an insertion or a deletion of one nucleotide in the HA2 region that would lead to frame-shifting and hence inactive protein expression (Fig. 1).\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 1.  Instability of the H9N2/SA HA-DNA in standard pHW2000 and pHH21 reverse genetic vectors.Sequencing data of the H9N2/SA HA-RT-PCR product showed nucleotide deletions (Clone A-D) and insertions (Clone E) when aligned with the reference sequence of influenza A virus (A/chicken/Saudi Arabia/CP7/1998, H9N2, GenBank accession number: CY081264.1) indicated by boxed areas. Arrows (grey) indicate direction of overlapping sequences obtained with forward and reverse sequencing primers.\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116917.g001\n\nChimeric H9-HA encoding-RG vectors\nIn comparison with the genetically stable HA segment of A/Chicken/Beijing/2/1997, H9N2 (H9N2/Bei), the HA1 region of H9N2/SA-HA shows a sequence homology of 88.5%, while the homology of the HA2 regions is 98.2%. Since the nucleotide deletion/insertions appeared in the HA2 (Fig. 1) after transformation of different RG vectors encoding the H9N2/SA HA-cDNA, we thought to generate a chimeric HA gene comprised of the H9N2/SA-HA1 region (containing the important antigenic sites for the generation of neutralizing antibodies [47]) ligated to the H9N2/Bei-HA2 region. By this approach we aimed to obtain a stable plasmid to create a recombinant vaccine virus expressing the desired epitopes [47]. To this point, two chimeric HAs were constructed\u2014pHW-HA-SA/Bei and pHW-HA-Bei/SA (control), cloned into pHW2000 and transformed into XL-1 blue. The first chimeric HA segment was composed of the HA1 region of H9N2/SA and the HA2 region as well as the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 non-coding regions (NCR) of H9N2/Bei (S1A Fig.). Under investigation the sequence of this chimeric HA also showed insertion/deletion instability in the HA2 region. In contrast, the sequence of the other chimeric HA possessing the HA1 of H9N2/Bei and the HA2 region as well as the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032-NCR of H9N2/SA (S1B Fig.) was genetically stable. Based on this finding, we favor that the instability of the cloned HA of H9N2/SA-cDNA is probably related to the sequence of the HA1 region, but its impact appears in the sequence of the HA2 region, preventing the use of the chimeric HA constructs.\n\n\nEfficient cloning and high genetic stability of HA segments upon transformation of vector-DNA into HB101 competent cells\nSince different E. coli genotypes with recA1 (DH5-alpha, DH10B, Top10 and Stbl4), recA-deficient (XL-1 blue), recB-deficient (Sure competent cells) or recA13/HB101-derived (Stbl3) failed to maintain the insert stability, we sought to transform the ligation reaction of pHW2000, pMPccdB or pHH21 with the HA-cDNA of H9N2/SA into recA13/HB101 competent cells. Notably, the HB101 could faithfully maintain insert stability. Following transformation, two phenotypes of the transformants were detected on the agar plates, large and small colonies (Fig. 2: A and C). Only transformants of the small-sized colonies showed the expected restriction digestion pattern (Fig. 2: B and D) as well as the correct nucleotide sequence even under commonly used temperature condition and antibiotic concentration (37\u00b0C, 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin). Nevertheless, unlike the transformants of large-sized colonies containing incorrect plasmids, the transformants of small-sized colonies containing stable plasmids only grew poorly, probably to restrain the expression of an aberrant toxic protein product. However, not only toxic gene products, but also other mechanisms or bacterial pathways affecting recombination and/or removal of toxic sequences could account for the genetic instability. To confirm the advantageous ability of HB101 to stabilize the vector/insert DNA, also the previously unstable HA-cDNA of H5N1/VSVRI cloned into pHW2000 vector was transformed into HB101 competent cells. Similarly, the small-sized HB101 transformants harbored the correct vector/insert constructs. In a trial to ensure that this reduction in colony size is related to the cloned HA-cDNA of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI, the HB101 cells were also transformed with stable pHW-HA-Beijing and pHW-HA-KanI (pHW2000 plasmids encoding the HA segment of A/Chicken/Beijing/2/1997(H9N2) or A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004(H5N1)). The pHW-HA-Beijing and pHW-HA-KanI transformants showed homogenous common large-sized colonies (S2 Fig.). This demonstrates that stability of genetic volatile inserts is probably maintained in HB101 by reduced bacterial growth.\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 2.

B) and D): Restriction analysis of pHW-H9N2/SA-HA and pHW-H5N1/VSVRI-HA plasmid DNA isolated from the HB101 transformants showed the expected digestion pattern only with small-sized colonies and an incorrect pattern with all large-sized colonies.\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116917.g002\n\nLow copy number pMKPccdB vector stabilizes HA-cDNAs of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI\nBased on the fact that the H9-HA-cDNA was stable in the backbone of pSMART-LC-Kan and on the previous study of Zhou et al., regarding the cloning of an unstable PB2 segment of A/Turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9) into pHH21[36], we replaced the backbone of pMPccdB [39] by pSMART-LC-Kan to construct an improved pMKPccdB (Fig. 3). The improved vector also contains the ccdB gene as a negative selection marker, which helps to ameliorate the screening process [39,48]. Furthermore, all BsmBI- and BsaI-sites in the backbone of pMKPccdB vector were masked by silent mutations and the final construct was generated in three versions with AarI, BsmBI or BsaI cloning sites.\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 3.  Construction strategy of the low-copy pMKPccdB reverse genetic vector to clone unstable HA segments of IAV.The resulting vector is a hybrid of pSMART-LC-Kan and the Pol-I/ccdB/Pol-II cassette of pMPccdB with either AarI or BsaI or BsmBI sites for restriction/cloning of the desired insert. Briefly, the sequence representing the Pol-I/ccdB/Pol-II cassette excised from pMPccdB by digestion with BsrBI were blunt end phosphorylated, and ligated into the EcoRV linearized pSMART-LC-Kan plasmid to generate pMKPccdB. The pMKPccdB was suitable to clone and maintain the genetically unstable RT-PCR product of H9N2/SA- and H5N1/VSVRI-HA. Transcriptional terminator (T); Repressor of Primer (ROP); low copy origin of replication (Ori); kanamycin resistance gene (Kanr), ampicillin resistance gene (Ampr).\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116917.g003Although the H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI HA-cDNAs cloned into the established pHH21, pHW2000, pMPccdB vectors were not stable in a wide range of E. coli strains except for the recA13/HB101, the same cDNAs showed high stability when cloned into the improved pMKPccdB vector and transformed into commonly used DH5-alpha, DH10B and XL-1 blue competent cells. This stability was illustrated by enzymatic digestion and verified by correct nucleotide sequencing (data not shown). To prove that the pMKPccdB is fully functional in regard to the rescue of recombinant IAV by RG, recombinant virus was generated using pMKPccdB plasmids encoding the entire eight viral segments of H9N2/Bei (data not shown).\nTo further test whether the backbone of the vector, would affect the Pol-II transcription efficiency of pMKPccdB we cloned the PB1 segment of influenza virus A/Hamburg/04/09 (Hamburg/H1N1) into pMKPccdB (pMKP-PB1-Hamburg) or pHW2000 (pHW-PB1-Hamburg, control). These were transfected into 293T cells together with pHW2000 plasmids containing the cloned PB2-, PA- and NP-segment of Hamburg/H1N1 expressing the according mRNAs and pPol-I-CAT-RT to generate a vRNA-like Pol-I-transcript encoding the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene in order to reconstitute viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP) expressing CAT [15]. When analyzing the CAT activities of the vRNPs reconstituted with either pMKP-PB1-Hamburg or pHW-PB1-Hamburg we found that they were comparable (Fig. 4A).\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 4.  Effect of pSMART-LC-Kan cassette on the transcription efficiency of pMKPccdB versus pHW2000 in eukaryotic cells.A) CAT activity in 293T cells: cells were transfected with pPOLI-CAT-RT plasmid and pHW2000 plasmids encoding PB2, PA and NP of A/Hamburg/04/09 (Hamburg/H1N1) together with pHW2000 or pMKPccdB encoding PB1 segment of the Hamburg/H1N1. 24 h post transfection, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT activity with [14C] chloramphenicol and thin-layer chromatography as previously described [15]. B) Western blotting analysis of expressed HA protein from H5N1/VSVRI: 293T cell monolayers were transfected in triplicates with pHW2000 or pMKPccdB plasmid DNA encoding the HA segment of H5N1/VSVRI (pHW-H5 HA/VSVRI and pMKP-H5 HA/VSVRI, respectively). 24 h post transfection, cells were lysed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane and detected by HA-specific antibodies. The amount of HA protein expressed by pMKP-H5 HA/VSVRI plasmid was similar to that expressed by pHW-H5 HA/VSVRI. Cellular beta actin was used for normalization. Error bars show standard deviation (SD) of the mean (N = 3). (ns) indicates a non-significant difference (P value<0.05).\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116917.g004Furthermore, the HA protein expression level of pHW2000 and pMKPccdB encoding the HA of H5N1/VSVRI (pHW-H5 HA/VSVRI and pMKP-H5 HA/VSVRI, respectively) was determined in eukaryotic 293T cells as a direct indicator of the efficiency of the Pol-II directed mRNA transcription. Confirming our results of the CAT activity derived from the plasmid based in vitro RNP reconstitution, the HA protein production level of pMKPccdB was comparable to that of pHW2000 plasmid (Fig. 4B). These findings clarify that the pSMART-LC-Kan backbone of pMKPccdB does not impair the function of the Pol-I/ccdB/Pol-II cassette derived from the pMPccdB vector in eukaryotic cells.\n\n\nRecombinant IVVS (6+2) viruses rescue and growth curve kinetic\nAfter we had demonstrated that we could generate genetically stable RG plasmids for the H9N2/SA-HA and the H5N1/VSVRI-HA, either with the help of the E. coli strain HB101 or with the new pMKPccdB vector in common E. coli strains, we next aimed to rescue 6+2 reassortant IVVS with the according HA and NA of either H9N2/SA or H5N1/VSVRI and RG plasmids carrying the remaining segments of PR8.\nTo attenuate the pathogenicity of the recombinant virus, the multi-basic cleavage site of H5-HA had been changed before to a mono-basic one [19,49\u201351]. The successfully rescued IVVS were detected with RT-PCR (S3A Fig.) and standard HA assay (S3B Fig.) and titrated using foci assay (Fig. 5: A and B). These IVVS generated by using the HA- and NA-cDNA cloned into the pMKPccdB vector (PR8-pMKP-H9N2 and PR8-pMKP-H5N1/LP) were compared with the corresponding reassortant viruses rescued by using the pHW2000 vector and HB101 (PR8-pHW-H9N2 and PR8-pHW-H5N1/LP). Notably, similar replication characteristics were detected for PR8-pMKP-H9N2 compared to PR8-pHW-H9N2 and for PR8-pMKP-H5N1/LP compared to PR8-pHW-H5N1/LP as determined by standardized HA assay (Fig. 5C) and focus forming assay (Fig. 5D).\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 5.  Characteristics of 6+2 reassortant viruses.The pMKPccdB plasmid allowed the rescue of PR8-H9N2 and PR8-H5N1-LP generated by HA- and NA-cDNAs of H9N2/SA or H5N1/VSVRI (with Monobasic HA) cloned either into pHW2000 (transformed into HB101) or pMKPccdB (transformed into DH5-alpha). The multibasic cleavage site of the H5N1/VSVRI-HA was mutated to a monobasic cleavage site. MDCK-II cells were infected with the reassortant viruses (MOI = 0.01) and allowed to replicate in media supplemented with1 \u03bcg/ml trypsin. Virus titers in the supernatants were shown 12, 24, 36 and 48 h p.i. in log10 HAU/ml (C) and log10 FFU/ml (D). Shown is the foci morphology (A, B) and the growth kinetics (C, D) of PR8-H9N2 or PR8-H5N1 reassortant viruses. Error bars indicate SD of the mean (N = 3).\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116917.g005\n\nDiscussionThe RG approach has facilitated and accelerated the basic research on IAV as well as vaccine development in the past two decades [18,52,53]. To generate recombinant IVVS, the RT-PCR copies of the eight viral segments are cloned precisely into an RG system to produce vRNAs of the eight viral genomic segments and at least the mRNAs of the viral polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, PA) and the nucleoprotein (NP). To obtain these vRNAs, the RT-PCR copies of the corresponding viral segments are cloned between an RNA polymerase I (Pol-I) promoter and terminator or the HDV ribozyme [13,14]. In order to express the necessary subunits of the viral polymerase and the NP that together with the vRNAs form the biological active RNPs, as well as the other viral proteins, the viral segments are also cloned between an RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) promoter and polyadenylation sequence [14,15,37]. The correct plasmids producing the vRNAs and mRNAs of IAV are then transfected together into suitable cells [54], to recover the recombinant IAV [14,44]. However, the occasional genetic instability of plasmids encoding the different viral genome segments (specially of HA and NA of candidate circulating or emerging IAV) in E. coli hinders a reliable and rapid construction of complete RG systems and the generation of IVVS. These are important pre-requisites to combat these strains and to assess their replication, virulence, pathogenicity, host range, and transmissibility. In this study, we demonstrate two different solutions to solve the stability problem of the cloned HA-segments from H5- and H9-subtypes transformed into different E. coli competent cells.\nThe plasmid vectors (for RG systems) are generally made from DNA sequences, derived from different sources such as bacteria and/or viruses and/or mammals. Occasionally, the foreign plasmid DNA can restrain or stop the growth of the bacterial host, undergoes structural rearrangement or can rapidly be lost during bacterial cell divisions [55]. Additionally, it is also well known that E. coli competent cells can introduce specific mutations and/or deletions in the foreign DNA to avoid the extensive aberrant expression of possibly toxic proteins and to maintain it in an inactive form. Therefore, different recA mutations were generated to minimize the occurrence of such insertions, deletions and plasmid DNA rearrangement caused by the recA protein of the bacteria [32].\nRecently, several studies have demonstrated that vaccination with chimeric HA constructs can improve the antigen yield against IAVs and also elicit efficient polyclonal humoral responses to the HA ecto- and stalk domain protecting against heterologous and heterosubtypic challenges [56\u201358]. In our case, we thought that this approach might be helpful to overcome the problem of HA instability as we detected the bacterial artifacts in the stalk domain (HA2), but not in the globular head domain (HA1) of the H9N2/SA-HA. Nevertheless, based on our findings with chimeric HA constructs, that the origin of the observed instability was related to the sequence of the HA1 region, but its impact appeared in stalk domain (HA2), this strategy of chimeric HAs did not provide a solution to avoid the genetic instability of the cloned HAs.\nTo find an E. coli strain that would stably maintain the recombinant plasmids (e.g. pHH21, pMPccdB and pHW2000) containing the HA-cDNAs of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI, we tested various recA alleles of standard competent bacteria; recA1 (DH5-alpha, DH10B, Top10 and Stbl4), recA-deficient (XL-1 blue), recB-deficient (Sure competent cells) and recA13 (HB101 and Stbl3). Unlike recA1, recA- and recB-deficient competent cells, the HA-RT-PCR products of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI were stably maintained in recA13/HB101 competent cells. The HB101 strain is a hybrid of E. coli K12 and B-bacteria, containing the recA13 mutation that minimizes recombination and supports insert stability. In addition, it carries the hsdS20(rB\u2212 mB\u2212) restriction and methylation minus genotype, derived from E. coli B-bacterium, to prevent the cleavage of cloned DNA by endogenous restriction enzymes and allows efficient cloning of the methylated DNA [59]. In contrast, the various competent cells, which failed to stabilize the plasmids encoding HA-segments of H9N2/SA and H5N1/VSVRI are derivatives of the wild type E. coli K12 strain. Therefore, we think that the ability of HB101 to stably maintain the inserts is related to a combination of the recA13 mutation and the genomic sequence derived from E. coli B-strain. Despite the fact that the Stbl3 E. coli strain also accommodates the recA13 mutation and is derived from HB101, it did not stabilize the cloned HA-segments (data not shown). This strain was engineered to produce high yield of plasmid DNA and to enhance the cloning of methylated genomic DNA. It was also modified to optimally stabilize cloned products into lentiviral vectors [55]. Presumably, these modifications of the Stbl3 strain lead to a loss of the advantageous property of the parental HB101 strain. Importantly, highly unstable HA segments like the H9N2/SA-HA were stable in HB101 in small-scale and large-scale cultivations at 30\u00b0C. Nevertheless, in general the HB101 strain produces only low yields of plasmid DNA, which is also unprotected from restriction enzymes due to the restriction-modification minus phenotype (r\u2212, m\u2212).\nRecently, the low-copy RG vector, pGJ3C3 was developed by substitution of the high copy number origin of replication (ori) from pUC in the standard unidirectional RG vector pHH21 with the low copy number ori of pSMART-LC-Kan (pBR322) [36]. Nevertheless, when we used the pHW2000, which also contains the low copy number ori (pBR322), the unstable HA constructs could not be stabilized in recA1 and recA-deficient bacteria. To this point, we constructed the bidirectional pMKPccdB RG vector based our previously published pMPccdB vector [39] and pSMART-LC-Kan to overcome the instability of the previously mentioned HA-cDNAs transformed into recA1 and recA-deficient competent bacteria. The improved RG system, pMKPccdB, combines the main features of pSMART-LC-Kan and pMPccdB. Several distinct elements derived from pSMART-LC-Kan ensure the maintenance of unstable inserts. Firstly, the repressor of primer (ROP) protein helps to down regulate and minimize the plasmid replication [60]. Secondly, the kanamycin selection is more stringent than ampicillin selection. Thirdly, the presence of three terminators derived from pSMART-LC-Kan prevents unwanted protein expression based on accidental promoter sequences present in the cloned genes. Despite the fact that cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter (derived from pMPccdB) has the ability to initiate gene expression in E. coli [61], we assume that due to the low copy number pBR322 ori, the ROP gene and three termination sites of pMKPccdB unwanted gene expression is prevented in E. coli. Furthermore, the change of the vector backbone of pSMART-LC-Kan did not affect the viral protein expression by the resulting pMKPccdB in eukaryotic cells when compared with standard pHW2000 vector in RG systems.\nMoreover, the pMKPccdB has an efficient and strong negative selection marker, the ccdB gene, allowing only E. coli clones to grow that carry the plasmid with the inserted DNA [39,62]. To further improve the vector for an efficient one-step cloning procedure [63,64], the sites of the commonly used type-II restriction enzymes BsaI and BsmBI, present in the pSMART-LC-Kan-derived backbone and in the ccdB gene (derived from of pMKPccdB) were deleted. Ultimately, the low copy number pMKPccdB RG vector containing the cloned cDNAs of the desired HA segments was successfully employed to reliably generate IVVS (6+2) for IAVs with indistinguishable replication characteristics compared to recombinant viruses engineered by the standard pHW2000 RG vector and HB101 strain. We should mention that our attempt to combine both strategies (transformation of HB101 with pMKPccdB) only resulted in a poor plasmid DNA yield and therefore was not superior to transformation of standard E. coli (e.g. XL1-blue) with pMKPccdB.\nIn summary, these improved strategies facilitate cloning and consequently the rescue of recombinant IAVs with unstable HA segments in the attempt to develop recombinant IVVS and will further allow basic research to focus on scientific questions regarding the biological characteristics of RG-derived recombinant IAVs.\n\nSupporting InformationS1 Fig. HA chimeras.Schematic diagram of HA chimeras constructed to circumvent the observed instability of the H9N2/SA-HA sequence, which we suspected to be located in the HA2-part, by exchanging the HA1 sequence of the pHW2000 plasmid (pHW-HA-Bei) stably encoding the A/Chicken/Beijing/2/1997 (H9N2/Bei) HA with the corresponding sequence from the pSMART-LC-Kan plasmid (pSMART-HA-SA) possessing the HA-cDNA of A/chicken/Saudi Arabia/CP7/1998 (H9N2/SA) and vice versa.

{"text": "Reverse genetics of influenza virus. \n Abstract \n Reverse genetics is the creation of a virus from a full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome, referred to as an \u201cinfectious clone,\u201d and is one of the most powerful genetic tools in modern virology. Since its development in 1999, plasmid-based reverse genetics has been effectively applied to numerous aspects of influenza studies which include revolutionizing the production of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine seed strains. Although continual improvement in reverse genetics system is being made in different laboratories for the efficient rescue of the influenza virus, the basic concept of synthesizing viral RNA using RNA polymerase I remains the same. Coupled with in vitro mutagenesis, reverse genetics can be applied widely to accelerate progress in understanding the influenza virus life cycle, the generation of customized vaccine seed strains, development of live-attenuated vaccines, and the use of influenza virus as vaccine and gene delivery vectors.Key wordsInfluenzaReverse geneticsInfectious cloneMutagenesisCloning\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDownload protocol PDF\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpringer Nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate Protocols.\u00a0Learn more\n\n\n1 IntroductionThe generation of influenza A viruses by reverse genetics has lagged mainly due to the inherent technical difficulties of providing sufficient amount of all eight viral RNAs from cloned cDNA. Since the initial development of plasmid-based rescue systems for influenza virus in 1999, rapid progress has been made which include identifying new host-specific RNA polymerase I promoter sequences and upgrading the reverse genetics plasmids for more efficient cloning [1].Recombinant DNA technology enables us to analyze and manipulate genomes at the molecular level. However, for non-retroviral RNA viruses, the genome does not enter a DNA phase during replication, and direct manipulation of fragile RNA substrates is challenging. For this reason, the study of the molecular biology of RNA viruses has lagged despite the small size of their genome [2]. Genetic manipulation of negative-strand RNA viruses, such as influenza virus (belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae), is even more demanding because isolated genome or antigenome RNAs are not infectious by themselves and because the virus is segmented. In order to serve as a functional template to initiate transcription/replication, the viral RNA (vRNA) has to be transcribed into a plus-sense mRNA by the polymerase complex, which includes the three viral polymerases (PB2, PB1, and PA) and the nucleoprotein (NP) [3]. Influenza virus has a genome comprised of eight RNA gene segments that must be expressed and packaged to complete the virus replication cycle. Furthermore, unlike many other RNA viruses, influenza virus replicates in the nucleus of infected cells, which has been one of the main hindrances in developing a reverse genetics system [4].The reverse genetics system for influenza virus was established in 1999 by two different research groups [5, 6], relying on the cellular enzyme RNA polymerase I for the synthesis of influenza viral RNAs. RNA polymerase I is an abundant nuclear enzyme that transcribes ribosomal RNA [7]. RNA polymerase I initiates and terminates transcription at defined promoter and terminator sequences and the resulting transcript does not contain additional nucleotides at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends. Thus, this enzyme is ideal for generation of influenza vRNA in the nucleus. Currently, de novo synthesis of influenza virus is achieved mostly by co-transfection of cells with 8\u201312 plasmids; eight plasmids contain a cDNA encoding one of each of the influenza viral RNAs between the RNA polymerase I promoter and the terminator, and additional plasmids or built-in expression systems within transcription plasmid that enables the expression of at least four viral proteins required for vRNA replication and transcription (PB1, PB2, PA, NP) (see Fig. 1). Although slight modifications are being introduced to improve the rescue system [8\u201310], the basic concept of synthesizing vRNA using the RNA polymerase I system remains the same.\nFig. 1Plasmid-based reverse genetics system. (a) Cells are transfected with eight transcription plasmids (transcribing the eight viral RNA segments) together with four protein (NP, PA, PB1, and PB2) expression plasmids or (b) eight bidirectional plasmids [7]. After 48 h of transfection, cell supernatants are inoculated into embryonating chicken eggs or MDCK cells depending on the strains being rescued.

Volumes of 0.1\u20130.25 ml of infectious amnio-allantoic fluid containing 106\u20131010 50 % egg infectious doses per ml (EID50/ml) of virus is typically sufficient for RNA. High viral titer samples are typically required for efficient amplification of the viral genes, and clinical material is usually not reliable for direct amplification of the full-length genes without propagation in culture. Eluted or resuspend the RNA in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl of RNase-free water (see\nNote\n\n2\n).\n\n\n2.\nThe entire coding and noncoding region of each of the eight individual gene segments are amplified by conventional reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (see\nNote\n\n3\n) with the primers listed in Subheading 2.1. The primers are directed to the 12 or 13 conserved bases at the ends of each influenza viral RNA segment and contain the BsmBI restriction site for cloning purposes. The RT step is performed with incubation steps of 45 \u00b0C for the PA, PB1, and PB2 genes and 50 \u00b0C for the other genes for 30 min. An additional step of 95 \u00b0C for 15 min is needed to activate the hot-start taq in the some kits and is not necessary with all RT-PCR reagents. The PCR incubation steps are 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C denaturation for 30 s, 53 \u00b0C annealing for 15 s, 72 \u00b0C extension for 60\u2013135 s depending on the length of the individual genes (see\nNote\n\n4\n).\n\n\n3.\nThe PCR products are separated on a 1 % agarose gel by electrophoresis and amplicons of the appropriate size are subsequently excised from the gel and extracted with a gel extraction kit according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\n3.2 Cloning3.2.1 Preparation of Inserts\n\n\n1.\nTo generate influenza virus entirely from cloned cDNA, at least 12 plasmids should be constructed (see\nNote\n\n5\n). The RT-PCR product of the NP, PA, PB1, and PB2 genes can be cloned directly into a eukaryotic expression vector (see\nNote\n\n6\n).\n\n\n(a)\nDigest the RT-PCR products (0.5\u20132 \u03bcg) with BsmBI restriction enzyme by adding 2 \u03bcl enzyme in a 20 \u03bcl reaction (with the supplied buffer for the enzyme). Incubate the reaction mix at 55 \u00b0C for at least 2 h.\n\n\n(b)\nSeparate on a 1 % agarose gel by electrophoresis and excise the digested products of the appropriate size from the gel and purify using a gel extraction kit. Although inserts of low concentration have been successfully cloned into the vector, it is recommended to prepare digested inserts of 25\u2013100 ng/\u03bcl (see\nNote\n\n7\n).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Preparation of pHH21 Vector\n\n\n1.\nEight transcription plasmids are constructed by inserting the eight individual viral genomic sequences between the human RNA polymerase I promoter and the mouse RNA polymerase I terminator sequence in the pHH21 vector following the procedure described below.\n\n\n(a)\nDigest the vector (2.5\u20135.0 \u03bcg) with BsmBI enzyme (3 \u03bcl) in a 30 \u03bcl reaction (with the supplied buffer for the enzyme). Incubate the reaction mix at 55 \u00b0C for at least 2 h. Separate the digested plasmid by electrophoresis on an agarose gel, and purify the digested vector as described above.\n\n\n(b)\nDephosphorylate the restriction-digested vector (50\u2013100 ng/\u03bcl) to prevent self-ligation by treating with SAP (1 unit/\u03bcg DNA) at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Then, inactivate the SAP by heating at 65 \u00b0C for 15 min. Briefly centrifuge the reaction mix. SAP-treated vectors may be used immediately or stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for later use.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Cloning into the pHH21\n\n\n1.\nLigate the digested insert and vector using LigaFast\u2122 Rapid DNA Ligation System. In a 10 \u03bcl ligation reaction, add 1 \u03bcl of vector (25\u2013100 ng), 3 \u03bcl of insert (75\u2013300 ng), 5 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 ligation buffer, and 1 \u03bcl of ligase. Mix the reaction gently and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n\n\n2.\nUse 2 \u03bcl of the above ligation reaction for transformation into competent cells. Follow the general transformation protocol that can be found elsewhere [11]. The pHH21 vector contains the ampicillin resistance gene and LB plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin can be used for clone selection (see\nNote\n\n8\n).\n\n\n3.\nThe presence and orientation of the insert can be screened using vector-specific primers in combination with a unique primer for the insert. Select and pick 6\u201312 colonies and culture them for 4 h in 200 \u03bcl of LB medium containing 100 \u03bcl/ml ampicillin in 96-well tissue culture plate at 37 \u00b0C. Use 1 \u03bcl of culture from each well as a template for 12.5 \u03bcl PCR reaction to screen for positive clones using the vector-specific primers.\n\n\n4.\nOnce clones with the correct inserts have been identified, perform a miniprep to obtain template for sequencing (a larger culture may need to be grown). The vector-specific primers can be used for sequencing to obtain full-length sequence of the insert.\n\n\n5.\nFor long-term storage prepare a glycerol stock of the bacterial cultures by mixing 700 \u03bcl of culture with 350 \u03bcl of glycerol in a cryo-vial and store in an ultra-low temperature freezer (<\u221270 \u00b0C).\n\n\n3.3 Preparation of Cells and Transfection\n\n\n1.\nPrepare cell cultures: 293T cells and MDCK cells are maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS at 37 \u00b0C in 5 % CO2. Vero cells are maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 10 % FBS with the same conditions. Due to the species specificity of the human RNA Polymerase I promoter [7], only cells from primate origin with high transfection efficiency (293T or Vero cells) can be used (see\nNote\n\n9\n). In general, lower rescue efficiency is observed using Vero cells compared to the 293T cells (see\nNote\n\n10\n). Since MDCK cells support the growth of many influenza viruses and can be grown in the same media as 293T cells, co-cultured 293T-MDCK cells can be used to improve the rescue efficiency of some strains of influenza virus [12].\n\n\n2.\nThe day before transfection, trypsinize the cells and plate approximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/2 ml per well in 6-well cell culture plate. For the 293T-MDCK co-culture, approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/ml cells of each cell line (1:1 of 293T to MDCK cells) is used. Nearly confluent (95\u2013100 %) cells at the time of transfection are ideal.\n\n\n3.\nTransfection: cells are transfected with a plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n\n(a)\nDilute 1 \u03bcg of appropriate plasmid (or 1 \u03bcg of each plasmid depending on the experiment) in 250 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM\u00ae I Reduced Serum Medium without serum.\n\n\n(b)\nDilute the 2 \u03bcl of Lipofetamine 2000 reagent per 1 \u03bcg of DNA used in 250 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM\u00ae I medium. Mix gently and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n\n\n(c)\nCombine the diluted plasmid with the diluted Lipofectamine 2000. Mix gently and incubate for 20 min at room temperature to allow the plasmid-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes to form.\n\n\n(d)\nAdd the 500 \u03bcl of plasmid-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture to the wells containing appropriate cells. Mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth.\n\n\n(e)\nIncubate the cells at 37 \u00b0C in a CO2 incubator for 24\u201348 h depending on the experiments.\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Confirmation of Integrity of RNA Pol I Promoter and Terminator for Influenza cDNA Transcription3.4.1 GFP Method\n\n\n1.\nIn the author\u2019s lab, the pPolI-NS-GFP plasmid which contains the GFP gene (derived from pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA)) in an antisense orientation was constructed [13]. The antisense GFP coding sequence, flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the nonstructural gene sequences of the A/turkey/Oregon/1971 avian influenza virus isolate, was fused exactly between the human RNA polymerase I promoter and the mouse RNA polymerase I terminator sequence in pHH21 vector. Transfection of this construct into eukaryotic cells leads to transcription of the reporter gene by cellular RNA polymerase I. Upon influenza virus infection, the artificial vRNAs are replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase complex, resulting in the expression of the reporter gene.\n\n\n(a)\nTransfect the nearly confluent 293T or Vero cells with 1 \u03bcg of pPolI-NS-GFP plasmid (see Subheading 3.3). The ability of the RNA Pol I promoter in pHH21 vector to drive synthesis of influenza viral RNA can be assessed using different methods. It is useful to generate a cDNA carrying a reporter gene in antisense orientation which is flanked by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions of an influenza viral RNA.

Successful expression of the viral proteins will produce green fluorescence signal in more than 50 % of a microscopic field.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Fluorescent Antibody (FA) Test\n\n\n1.\nAn FA test can also be performed if the pPolI-NS-GFP or similar construct is not available, but an antibody specific for the individual influenza viral protein of interest is available (e.g., monoclonal antibody against HA protein).\n\n\n(a)\nCo-transfect 293T cells with plasmids (1 \u03bcg per plasmid) expressing the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins together with the pHH21 vector that contains, for example, the HA gene if that is a protein to which antibody is available.\n\n\n(b)\nForty-eight hours after transfection, wash the cells twice with warm PBS.

Use 1 \u03bcg of each plasmid and 24 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent for the transfection (see Subheading 3.3).\n\n\n(b)\nForty-eight hours after transfection, freeze the cells. Repeat freezing and thawing twice (for a total of three freeze\u2013thaw cycles).\n\n\n(c)\nCollect the supernatant and disrupted cells. Inoculate into 9\u201311-day-old SPF chicken embryos (see Chapter 12). After 48 h of incubation harvest the amnio-allantoic fluid, which should contain the infectious virus if the rescue was successful. Store at \u221280 \u00b0C for later use (see\nNote\n\n12\n).\n\n\n(d)\nThe presence of infectious virus can be confirmed by hemagglutinin (HA) test (see Chapter 1).\n\n\n(e)\nThe identity of the rescued virus should be confirmed by sequencing each of the eight viral gene segments.\n\n\n\n\n3.7 Helper Virus-Based Reverse Genetics\n\n\n1.\nConstruction of eight transcription plasmids for every virus to be rescued can be demanding and labor intensive. This section briefly describes an alternative method of generating virus using only one transcription plasmid and a helper virus. This method, however, requires a strong selection system for reassortant virus being rescued. In the helper virus-based reverse genetics, a plasmid containing a cDNA encoding the vRNA to be rescued between the RNA polymerase I promoter and the RNA polymerase I terminator is transfected into cells. Intracellular transcription by RNA polymerase I produces vRNA from a cDNA template, which is then packaged into progeny virus particles upon helper virus infection. With this method, reassortant viruses (i.e., viruses containing RNA derived from cloned cDNA with the remaining genes from a helper virus) are selected from the vast helper virus population and thus require a strong selection system. Here, we describe the generation of HA gene reassortant which may grow in cell culture and form plaques without the addition of trypsin to the media (an indicator of high pathogenicity for poultry) from a low pathogenic parent virus using this system [15] (see Fig. 2).\nFig. 2Helper virus-dependent reverse genetics system. Cells are transfected with a plasmid containing a cDNA that encodes a HA gene from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus which has ability to be cleaved in the absence of trypsin, flanked by RNA polymerase I promoter and terminator sequences. Transcription of HA gene RNA occurs by cellular RNA polymerase I upon transfection. After infection with influenza helper virus which is low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) virus with no ability to form plaques without trypsin, newly synthesized mutated HA gene RNA undergoes replication, transcription, and is packaged into a progeny virus particle. Because the LPAI virus does not form plaques in CEF cells, the presence of plaques indicates a potential reassortant virus containing the HA gene from the HPAI virus. Reassortants are further confirmed by purification and sequencingFull size image\n\n\n(a)\nNearly confluent 293T cells are transfected with 1 \u03bcg of transcription plasmid that contains desired HA gene sequence, together with the four expression plasmids by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (see Subheading 3.3).\n\n\n(b)\nTwenty-four hours after transfection, the cells are infected with low pathogenic avian influenza viruses that do not form plaques in CEF cells without the addition of trypsin (MOI\u2009=\u20091.0).\n\n\n(c)\nForty hours after infection, the supernatants of the infected cells are collected and used to infect CEF cells.\n\n\n(d)\nReassortant viruses in the supernatants are screened by sequencing the virus from plaques formed in the CEF cells. Because the helper virus does not form plaques in CEFs, the plaques are most likely formed by the reassortant virus that contains the HA gene from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus which can grow in cell culture without trypsin.\n\n\n\n\n4 Notes\n\n\n1.\nThe primers are designed based on the published sequence. However, influenza viral sequence varies in the noncoding region [13] and it is recommended to sequence the noncoding ends of the gene segments of specific isolate to be rescued and modify the primer sequences accordingly.\n\n\n2.\nIn general, RNA extraction with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Inc.) yields higher concentration of RNA than magnetic beads or RNA columns. If a high enough titer or high enough concentration of virus is not available, it is recommended to use Trizol reagent and then use less water for the final reconstitution of the RNA pellet.\n\n\n3.\nRT-PCR reactions can introduce unwanted mutations and the product is not always an accurate copy of the template molecule. To reduce the rate of inaccurate synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, the use of high fidelity RT-PCR kits available from numerous companies is recommended.\n\n\n4.\nIn many cases, the larger size genes (PA, PB1, and PB2) are difficult to amplify in full length. In that case, first consider using a two-step RT-PCR reaction, which is generally more sensitive than one-step RT-PCR. If the two-step RT-PCR does not improve the amplification, those gene segments can be amplified in two parts using internal primers and those segments can be ligated to create a full-length gene.\n\n\n5.\nReverse genetics of influenza virus using 8- or 3-plasmids has also been developed [8, 9]. Twelve and eight plasmid systems are most popular and both systems work efficiently for the rescue of influenza virus. Although eight plasmid system may be more convenient since it requires constructing fewer plasmids, the 12 plasmid system may work more efficiently if rescue involves the introduction of several mutations that may affect the function of the NP or polymerase proteins.\n\n\n6.\nCloning into the pCR3.1 vector is an easier approach, since subcloning into another vector is not required. Other eukaryotic expression vectors such as pCI, pCI-neo (Promega), PCAGGS.MCS, pCDNA3.1 have been used by our lab and others [5, 16].\n\n\n7.\nIf the concentration of the RT-PCR product is too low, cloning the product into vectors such as TA vectors (Invitrogen) is recommended. Then, the insert can be efficiently subcloned into the pHH21 vector.\n\n\n8.\nRecently, two different groups have reported improvements in reverse genetics plasmid by incorporating additional selection markers into the vector for rapid and efficient cloning [17, 18].\n\n\n9.\nChicken and canine RNA polymerase I promoter sequences have been described for use in avian cells (CEF and QT-6 cells) and MDCK cells, respectively, for the generation of influenza virus [19, 20].\n\n\n10.\nRecently, Vero cell RNA polymerase I-driven reverse genetics system was developed which showed enhanced level of transcription and virus rescue rates compared to that of human RNA Pol I promoter-driven system in Vero cells [21].\n\n\n11.\nAlthough infectious viruses can be generated with plasmids expressing just four essential proteins, PA, PB1, PB2, and NP, the expression of the remaining structural proteins may increase the efficiency of virus production [5].\n\n\n12.\nSome mammalian-origin influenza viruses (such as triple reassortant H3N2 virus from turkeys) do not grow readily in embryonating chicken eggs or 293T cells [22], therefore it is recommended to blind passage the supernatant from transfected cells 3\u20135 times in MDCK cells (see Chapter 22)."}
{"text": "A simple and fast system for cloning influenza A virus gene segments into pHW2000- and pCAGGS-based vectors. \n Abstract \n The reverse genetics system for influenza A viruses described by Hoffmann et al. (Virology 267(2):310\u2013317, 2000, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97(11):6108\u20136113, 2000, ArchVirol 146(12):2275\u20132289, 2001) is one of the most commonly used. However, this cloning strategy is rather time-consuming and lacks a selection marker to identify positive clones carrying viral genes. We report here the optimization of the cloning protocol of viral genes into pHW2000 by (i) introducing a selection marker and (ii) simplifying the cloning strategy: now the cloning reaction takes only a few minutes and, in addition, is independent of internal restriction sites for BsmBI/Esp3I, BsaI or AarI. In order to accelerate the whole cloning protocol for the generation of recombinant viruses, we first introduced a lacP/Z-element (lac-promoter/lacZ\u03b1-fragment) between the two BsmBI sites of pHW2000 to allow selection of positive clones by blue/white screening. Then we optimized the digestion/ligation-protocol: In our system, enzymatic digestion and ligation of PCR products into the vector is performed in a single \u201cone-tube\u201d reaction. Due to this strategy, time and material consumption is reduced by a great amount, as vector and cDNA do not have to be digested and purified prior to the ligation. Therefore, this one-tube reaction yields positive clones with high efficiency and fidelity, again saving time and material, which were formerly required for screening and analyzing clones. Finally, to add more versatility to the system, we also created an entry vector based on TA-cloning. This entry vector provides several advantages: inserted genes can easily be modified, e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis or tag attachment, and then subcloned into pHW2000 or other plasmids containing a similar cloning site (e.g., our modified pCAGGS-Esp-blue) by the same rapid and reliable one-tube reaction protocol described here. In fact, the presented protocol is suitable to be adapted to other reverse genetics systems (e.g., those for members of the order Mononegavirales or the family Bunyaviridae) or cloning of genes in general.\n\n\n\nAccess provided by North East Research Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking on a manuscript?\nAvoid the common mistakes\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductionThe generation of recombinant influenza A viruses from cloned cDNA provides a powerful tool to study the effects of reassortment events or single point mutations in viral genes. One of the most commonly used cloning systems is the bidirectional approach first described by Hoffmann and colleagues [1, 2]. In the described plasmid (pHW2000), the viral gene is flanked by both a pol II promoter element (truncated CMV promoter, bovine growth hormone poly-A signal [BGHpA]) and a pol I promoter element (truncated human pol I promoter, truncated murine pol I terminator) in positive and negative orientation, respectively. Therefore, from this plasmid, both viral mRNA (pol II) and vRNA (pol I) can be synthesized without the need of additional helper viruses or further transfection with other polymerase genes, e.g., influenza polymerase subunits [4, 5] or T7 RNA polymerase [6].Due to the nature of the pol I promoter [7], viral genes have to be cloned into pHW2000 via a defined protocol in order to maintain the sequence integrity of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of cRNA and vRNA. To achieve this specificity, a set of \u201coutside cutting\u201d endonucleases can be utilized: BsmBI (or its isoschizomer Esp3I), BsaI or AarI, as described by Hoffmann et al. [3]. These enzymes cut within a defined distance of the recognition site (e.g., for Esp3I, the recognition site is CGTCTCN1/N5) and thereby create overhangs with sequences that can be different from that of the recognition site itself. This property thus allows the ligation of viral genes into pHW2000 without adding, removing or changing the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the viral RNA. There are, however, several circumstances that make cloning of a complete viral genome by the standard cloning technique difficult. Typically, viral cDNA is generated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) after RNA extraction. This cDNA has to be purified to remove small by-products and components of the reaction mix. Afterwards, the purified cDNA is digested by one of the three enzymes mentioned above to generate sticky ends for ligation. Here, the first difficulty arises as some viral genes contain recognition sites in their sequence for one or more of these three endonucleases. Representative examples are given in the publication of Hoffmann et al. [3], where WSN-PB2 contains two BsmBI sites while WSN-PB1 contains three BsaI sites and NP contains one AarI site. A mix of cloning primers, as described by Hoffmann and colleagues [3], is therefore required to create the full recombinant WSN set of plasmids. Next, the digested viral cDNA has to be purified again from the reaction mix prior to the ligation. After ligation and transformation of competent bacteria, clones have to be selected for analysis. Here, another drawback of the original pHW2000 plasmid is the lack of a selection marker helping to identify positive clones. This means that in the case of difficult-to-clone genes such as HA or PB2, a large number of clones have to be analyzed. This again is another time-consuming and expensive step.In order to improve cloning efficiency and reduce time and material cost, we decided to modify pHW2000 and the whole cloning protocol in several ways. First of all, we introduced the lac operon (lacP/Z), containing the lac promoter and lacZ\u03b1 gene, into pHW2000 as a selection marker for blue/white screening to identify clones carrying a viral gene. Next, we adapted the one-tube cloning protocol that has been described for the commercially available StarGate\u00ae cloning system (IBA GmbH G\u00f6ttingen, Germany [8]) and by Engler and colleagues [9] for cloning influenza gene segments into our modified plasmids. Since the general idea of our protocol is not restricted to pHW2000 alone, we also created pCAGGS-blue variants of this high-level expression plasmid [10] for Esp3I or BsaI cloning. In addition to that, we created an entry vector based on the well-characterized TA cloning system [11], which allows easy modification of viral genes and transfer of such genes by a one-tube reaction into any plasmid providing the matching four-nucleotide overhangs.Materials and methodsGeneration of modified pHW2000- and pCAGGS plasmidsAll kits and enzymes were obtained from Fermentas/Thermo Scientific if not indicated otherwise. I) pHW2000-Esp-blue was generated from the pHW2000 [2] vector. First, lacP/Z (accession no. FB506781.1) was amplified from the pASG vector (IBA) by PCR using the indicated primers (forward, 5\u2032 AAGGGAAGAGACGCTGCAGCCCAATACGCAAAC 3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032 TTTATTTGAGACGCTCGAGGTGAACCATCACCC 3\u2032; the Esp3I recognition motif is underlined) and the proofreading Phusion Polymerase in HF buffer. Then, pHW2000 and the resulting PCR product were digested with Esp3I, separated by gel electrophoresis and extracted using a gel extraction kit. Ligation using T4 DNA ligase was performed for 1 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Competent DH5\u03b1 cells were transformed with the mixture [12] and plated onto LB-ampicillin plates containing X-Gal and IPTG. Blue colonies were picked, and clones were analyzed by restriction mapping. II) In pHW2000\u0394-Esp-blue, we deleted all vector-based BsaI sites (Fig.\u00a01, highlighted in bold; for this and all other vectors, \u201c\u0394\u201d indicates BsaI-free). For this, we first exchanged the ApaLI fragment (containing part of the ampicillin cassette and part of the ori region) (Fig.\u00a01, framed) as follows: pHW2000-Esp-blue and pESG5 (IBA) were digested with ApaLI (NEB), and fragments were purified using a gel extraction kit and ligated. The resulting plasmid (pHW2000i-Esp-blue) thus contained only one remaining BsaI site. To remove this second BsaI site, pHW2000i-Esp-blue was digested with NheI and NcoI, and pESG5 was digested with NcoI and XbaI to exchange part of the CMV enhancer/promoter (Fig.\u00a01, underlined). Again, both fragments were purified by gel extraction and ligated. The resultant vector, pHW2000\u0394-Esp-blue, was now free of any internal BsaI sites. III) Vector pHW2000\u0394-Bsa-blue was generated by exchanging the lacP/Z insert. For this, pHW2000\u0394-Esp-blue was digested with Esp3I. The new lacP/Z was amplified from pHW2000-Esp-blue by PCR with the indicated primers (forward, 5\u2032 TATAGGGAAGAGACCCTGCAGCCCAATACGCAAAC 3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032 TTAATATTTGAGACCCTCGAGGTGAACCATCACCC 3\u2032; the BsaI recognition motif is underlined) and digested with BsaI (NEB). The vector and PCR product were extracted from a gel and ligated, and clones were analyzed by restriction mapping. IV) pCAGGS-Esp-blue, pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue and pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blue were generated by exchanging the ApaLI fragment and inserting lacP/Z fragments as described above.Fig.\u00a01Plasmid maps of pHW2000-Esp-blue and  pCAGGS-Esp-blue. These plasmids where used for the generation of the \u0394BsaI variants of pHW2000 and pCAGGS (pHW2000\u0394-Esp-blue, pHW2000\u0394-Bsa-blue, pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue and pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blue, respectively). For both pHW2000 and pCAGGS, the ApaLI fragment indicated (framed restriction sites) was exchanged with the corresponding ApaLI fragment of pESG-IBA5, which does not contain an internal BsaI restriction site. In pHW2000, the second BsaI site was removed by exchanging the corresponding fragment of the pESG-IBA5 vector (NcoI and NheI, underlined restriction sites). The vector-based BsaI restriction sites are shown in bold typeFull size image\nConstruction of the entry vector pEntryTThe entry vector for TA cloning pEntryT was constructed by digestion of pBluescript (Stratagene) using LguI and AdeI to isolate lacP/Z. After digestion, ends of the excised lacP/Z were blunted using T4 DNA polymerase. The kanamycin backbone (including ori) was amplified by PCR from Entry-Vector (IBA) with the following primers: forward, 5\u2032 ATCCAAAGGCGGTAATACGGTTATC 3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032 TGGCACTTTTCGGGGAAATGTGC 3\u2032. The backbone and lacP/Z fragments were ligated, and chemically competent DH5\u03b1 cells were transformed with the ligated fragments and plated onto LB-kanamycin plates with X-Gal and IPTG. Plasmid DNA from blue clones was analyzed. The vector that was obtained was then linearized with EcoRV and purified using a PCR purification kit. T-overhangs were generated using Taq polymerase [13] as follows: Linearized vector was incubated in Taq buffer with MgCl2 and dTTP. After 2\u00a0h at 72\u00a0\u00b0C, the vector was purified and ligated overnight at 16\u00a0\u00b0C. This ligation step eliminates vectors without or with only one T-tail by re-ligation, dimerisation or oligomerisation. The linear vector containing T-overhangs was then purified by gel extraction.Generation of PCR fragmentsTo perform the following exchange reaction or for entry cloning, we generated viral cDNAs using the primers pairs described by Hoffmann and colleagues [3], except those for the NA segment. The following NA primers were used to generate overhangs with Esp3I instead of BsaI: forward Bs-NA-1, 5\u2032 TATTCGTCTCAGGGAGCAAAAGCAGGAGT 3\u2032, and reverse Bs-NA-1413R, 5\u2032 ATATCGTCTCGTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGAGTTTTTT 3\u2032 (the Esp3I recognition motif is underlined). As the template for our experiments, we used cloned segments of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) in pHW2000. The PCR conditions were as described [3], and the PCR products were isolated by gel extraction.Transfer into pHW-blue and pCAGGS-blue vectorsWe used 25\u00a0ng plasmid DNA and PCR products of PB1 (120\u00a0ng), PA (115\u00a0ng), HA (90\u00a0ng), NP (80\u00a0ng), NA (70\u00a0ng), M (55\u00a0ng), NS (45\u00a0ng) for transfer into pHW2000-Esp-blue, and 120\u00a0ng of PB2 PCR product for transfer into pHW2000\u0394-Bsa-blue. For transfer of NA into pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue we used 50\u00a0ng plasmid DNA instead. For transfer of PB2 into pHW2000\u0394-Esp-blue and pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue, we used 240\u00a0ng PCR product and a 1:2 mixture of Esp3I and BsaI. For transfer of PB2 into pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blue, we used 120\u00a0ng of PCR product and BsaI only. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 1 h at RT. The incubation at RT is only necessary if the segment contains internal Esp3I or BsaI restriction sites (i.e., PB2 or NA), the addition of fresh T4 DNA ligase or ATP is not required, as 37\u00a0\u00b0C is within the temperature optimum of the enzyme of 16-37\u00a0\u00b0C according to the manufacturer (Fermentas/Thermo Scientific). In Table\u00a01, the composition of each reaction mix is listed.Table\u00a01 Composition of reaction mixes for cloning of cDNAs into pHW and pCAGGS vectorsFull size table\nTransfer into pEntryTTo generate A-overhangs, the PCR product was incubated in Taq buffer with dNTPs and Taq polymerase for 25 minutes at 72\u00a0\u00b0C. After this step, the PCR product was purified using a PCR purification kit, and its concentration was measured. The ratio of vector to insert should be 1:2. The size of the vector is 2.5 kb, and the composition of the reaction mix is given in Table\u00a02.Table\u00a02 Reaction mix for TA cloning of cDNA into pEntryTFull size table\nThe reaction was incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. As an example, we inserted the NA segment (70\u00a0ng) and PB2 (115\u00a0ng) into the pEntryT vector to obtain pEntry-NA and pEntry-PB2. Two microliters of each reaction mix was introduced into 50\u00a0\u03bcl of chemically competent DH5\u03b1 cells, which were then plated onto LB-ampicillin plates with X-Gal and IPTG. DNA from white clones was analyzed. It has been published that the proportion of positive clones is around 80\u00a0% when using the Taq method, and 90\u00a0% when using terminal transferase and ddTTP [13].Transfer from pEntry-NA and pEntry-PB2 into destination vectors (pHW2000-Esp-blue, pHW2000\u0394-Bsa-blue, pCAGGS-Esp-blue or pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blue)The reaction conditions are given in Table\u00a01. The amount of entry vector (pEntry-NA/pEntry-PB2) instead of the PCR product in this reaction was 100\u00a0ng.Transfer of the M and HA segments into pHW2000-Esp-blue (kinetics)A double standard reaction was prepared (50\u00a0\u03bcl, see Table\u00a01) without adding Esp3I. Of this, 2\u00a0\u03bcl was taken as the 0 minute control. Next we added Esp3I and transferred 9\u00a0\u03bcl to a single tube for each time point. Incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C was stopped after 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes by transferring the tube to liquid nitrogen. After the last sample was collected, all tubes were thawed, and 2\u00a0\u03bcl of each reaction mixture was added to 50\u00a0\u03bcl of competent DH5\u03b1 cells. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes and 30 seconds at 42\u00a0\u00b0C. After an additional 2 minutes on ice, the cells were plated onto LB-ampicillin plates with X-Gal and IPTG.The concentrations of plasmid DNA and PCR products were determined using a Nanodrop 1000, (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). Pictures of the reaction kinetic experiment were created using Molecular Imager\u00ae ChemiDoc XRS+ (BIO-RAD, Munich, Germany). Plasmid maps were generated with CloneManager 9 Basic Edition (Scientific & Educational Software).ResultsThe lacP/Z gene region was cloned between the two BsmBI/Esp3I-sites, replacing the short nucleotide spacer between the restriction sites. If the ligation of a viral gene is successful, the whole lacP/Z is replaced by the viral gene, ensuring the correct expression of viral RNA from the plasmid. Next, we performed restriction digestion of both vector and purified cDNA, as well as ligation in a single reaction. To obtain higher restriction/ligation-rates, we decided to use the isoschizomer Esp3I (Fermentas/Thermo Scientific) instead of BsmBI (NEB). Esp3I has a temperature optimum of 37\u00a0\u00b0C instead of 55\u00a0\u00b0C for BsmBI, resulting in a higher activity of the T4 DNA ligase, which has a temperature optimum around 16-37\u00a0\u00b0C.Direct cloning of viral cDNAs into pHW2000-Esp-blue, pHW2000\u0394-Esp-blue, pHW2000\u0394-Bsa-blue, pCAGGS-Esp-blue, pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue and pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blueThe mechanism of the exchange reaction is illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. Both the PCR product (highlighted in dark gray throughout the figure) (Fig.\u00a02A) and the vector (Fig.\u00a02B) are digested by Esp3I or BsaI in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. Due to the parallel digestion/ligation reaction, the cleaved ends of the PCR product, as well as LacP/Z can be re-ligated and re-cut. Thus, reactions A and B are both equilibrium reactions. However, reaction C is the key step of this cloning system. Since the Esp3I recognition sequences are located at the far ends of the PCR product and LacP/Z, they are removed from both viral cDNA and the vector after digestion. Therefore, once the vector and the cDNA are ligated, this product cannot be digested with Esp3I or BsaI anymore, removing it from the reaction equilibrium of digestion/re-ligation (Fig.\u00a02C). In the case of cDNAs where no internal Esp3I sites are present (PB1, HA, PA, NP, M and NS), an incubation of up to 1 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C is sufficient, and competent bacteria can be transformed directly with the plasmids (in this experiment we used DH5\u03b1, but in principle, any strain with the \u0394lacZM15 genotype would be suitable). If there are internal Esp3I recognition sites (NA has one internal Esp3I motif), the end product of the reaction is an equilibrium between closed and open vector. This equilibrium can be shifted towards the closed vector by further incubation at RT due to the different temperature optima of Esp3I (37\u00a0\u00b0C) and T4 DNA ligase (16-37\u00a0\u00b0C). The same applies for segments with two internal Esp3I sites (PB2).Fig.\u00a02Direct cloning of cDNAs into pHW2000-/pCAGGS-blue vectors. A: Both ends of the PCR product (highlighted in gray) are cleaved by Esp3I/BsaI and can be re-ligated or re-cut during the reaction. B: Esp3I/BsaI digestion of the vector removes the selection marker, creating compatible ends for ligation of the PCR product. The vector and selection marker can be re-ligated or re-cut as well. C: Since Esp3I/BsaI digestion removes the recognition sites from both the PCR product and the vector, the PCR product cannot be re-cut from the final ligation product once ligation has occurredFull size image\nPlasmids pHW2000-Esp-blue, pHW2000\u0394-Esp-blue, pHW2000\u0394-Bsa-blue, pCAGGS-Esp-blue, pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue and pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blue were generated and prepared as described in Materials and methods. Viral cDNAs for all eight gene segments were generated and purified by gel extraction. The specific one-tube reaction conditions for each gene segment are listed in Table\u00a01 and explained in detail in Materials and methods. Table\u00a03 gives an overview of the results obtained for all viral cDNAs and the restriction enzymes used for analysis. As indicated, direct cloning of cDNAs into the modified pHW2000 vector yields a very large number of positive clones (12 of 12 for all genes), which can be easily discriminated from negative clones, which turn blue.Table\u00a03 Analysis of clones after direct cloning into pHW vectorsFull size table\nFor direct cloning of cDNAs into our modified pCAGGS plasmids, we selected PB2 and NA as examples, because they both contain internal Esp3I sites (two in PB2 and one in NA) and therefore represent difficult-to-clone genes. As listed in Table\u00a04, our system again resulted in a very large number of positive clones (pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue (PB2 12/12) pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blue (PB2 11/12) and pCAGGS\u0394-Esp-blue (NA 12/12), as determined by restriction analysis.Table\u00a04 Analysis of clones after direct cloning into pCAGGS vectorsFull size table\nCloning into pEntryT by TA cloning and subcloning of cDNAs into pHW- and pCAGGS-related vectorsSubcloning of segments from one plasmid into another is a common technique. It is often easier and faster to use commercially available systems such as TA cloning to quickly clone a given gene in order to obtain sequence information or to simply amplify enough DNA for traditional cloning methods. In the case of influenza virus genes, however, TA cloning requires some further consideration. Subcloning of a TA-cloned cDNA into pHW2000 using any other restriction enzyme other than the three described outside cutters, BsmBI/Esp3I, BsaI and AarI, is impossible, since the restrictive requirements of the pol I promoter cassette do not allow any modification of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the viral cDNA/RNA. Excision of the viral cDNA by one of the aforementioned restriction enzymes and successive ligation into pHW2000 is possible, but again, this step faces the already described problems of time and material consumption as well as the consideration of internal restriction sites. Especially for enzymes like BsaI, which was used previously as a restriction enzyme for cloning of PB2 and NA, internal TA-vector BsaI sites can make the cloning procedure even more complicated. Since digestion and ligation reactions in our new cloning system are performed in a single tube, it is important to separate the template vector from the resulting vector after the reaction. Therefore, we designed our TA cloning vector to harbor an antibiotic resistance cassette that is different from pHW2000 and pCAGGS. Both plasmids carry an ampicillin selection cassette. For this reason, we constructed a small vector as an entry vector for TA cloning that lacks internal BsaI or BsmBI/Esp3I sites and provides kanamycin resistance.The cloning procedure for the TA entry vector is presented in Fig.\u00a03A. First, we prepared the entry vector pEntryT and the purified cDNAs of two gene segments as described in Materials and methods. For our experiments, we again selected PB2 and NA for the same reasons as described above. As listed in Table\u00a05, ligation of both cDNAs was successful and yielded a large number of positive clones (pEntry-PB2 7/10 and pEntry-NA 9/12) as determined by digestion and gel electrophoresis. We next selected one of the positive clones of each gene for subcloning (Fig.\u00a03B) into pHW2000\u0394-Bsa-blue and pCAGGS\u0394-Bsa-blue (PB2) or pHW2000-Esp-blue and pCAGGS-Esp-blue (NA). The results of this experiment are listed in Table\u00a06. The transfer reaction yielded a large number of white colonies, and restriction analysis of white colonies resulted in 12 out of 12 clones being positive for all reactions except pHW2000-NA (11/12).Fig.\u00a03Cloning of cDNA into TA-vector pEntryT and subcloning into pHW-/pCAGGS-plasmids. A: First, the A-tailed PCR product (highlighted in gray) is ligated into T-tailed pEntryT by TA cloning. pEntryT is suitable for mutagenesis or modification of the insert. B: To subclone the gene of interest from the entry vector into any target vector (e.g., pHW2000- and pCAGGS-Esp or Bsa-blue), the same one-tube reaction described for direct cloning can now be employed. In the case of BsaI digestion, the \u201c\u0394-plasmids\u201d are recommended for a higher ligation efficiency, since all internal BsaI sites have been removed. Note that pEntryT and the target vectors confer kanamycin and ampicillin resistance, respectively, for positive selection of clonesFull size image\nTable\u00a05 Analysis of clones after TA cloning into pEntryTFull size table\nTable\u00a06 Transfer rate of PB2 and NA from pEntryT into pHW and pCAGGS vectorsFull size table\nDirect cloning in a single reaction is performed in a few minutesTo analyze whether a longer incubation time in our one-tube reaction would result in an even higher yield of positive clones, we performed a reaction kinetics experiment. We selected the M segment as well as the HA segment (M represents an easy-to-clone segment, whereas HA is difficult to clone), and incubated the reaction for one hour. We stopped the reaction after 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes by freezing and thereafter transformed competent DH5\u03b1 bacteria. As depicted in Fig.\u00a04, we obtained a very large number of white clones compared to blue colonies after only five minutes of incubation. The ratio of white to blue colonies can be further improved by a longer incubation time, with only a few colonies turning blue after one hour of incubation. For HA, we obtained fewer white colonies after five minutes of incubation (data not shown). However, of these, 12 of 12 colonies were positive for HA insertion, as determined by restriction digestion. With a prolonged reaction time, the number of blue colonies decreased, and after one hour of incubation, the ratio of blue to white colonies was comparable to that obtained with the M segment.Fig.\u00a04Reaction kinetics of the M segment. LB plates (Amp/IPTG/X-Gal) for the cloning reaction of the M segment were scanned with Molecular Imager\u00ae ChemiDoc XRS+. As little as 5 minutes of digestion/ligation yields a large number of white colonies. With increasing reaction time, the number of blue colonies decreasesFull size image\nDiscussionIn order to generate recombinant influenza viruses, the cloning system published by Hoffmann et al. [2] has several advantages over other published systems (i.e., the reduced amount of plasmids needed, no need for another helper virus or complementary RNA polymerase). Another reason why this system is so easy to use is that it is compatible with the cloning method described in ref 3. To generate a full set of eight influenza virus genes for the generation of recombinant viruses, only a small number of cloning primers is needed. As we have already pointed out, however, there are some disadvantages of the protocol described in those two publications, namely the need to select the appropriate cloning primers based on internal restriction sites within the genes of interest and, subsequently, the time and materials needed to purify and screen the ligation components and the resulting clones.While in the process of creating a new recombinant virus, we faced some difficulties with the cloning procedure, initiating our search for a way to clone viral genes and screen for positive clones. Here, we present a new protocol in which we have modified the previously described plasmids pHW2000 and pCAGGS to allow a fast and reliable screening of positive clones by blue/white screening and, furthermore, optimized the cloning protocol itself. It is now possible to generate plasmids that are ready for use in the generation of recombinant viruses or protein expression in a one-tube reaction with very high efficiency within a few minutes. We combined the cloning strategies from different sources (TA Cloning\u00ae from Invitrogen, StarGate\u00ae Cloning from IBA) and designed our own protocol, which was optimized for the cloning of influenza virus genes into pHW2000 and pCAGGS.The one-tube restriction/ligation protocol we have presented here has several advantages compared to the standard cloning protocol:\n\n1.\nThe amount of insert DNA and plasmid DNA required has been reduced from several micrograms to a few nanograms.\n\n\n2.\nNeither the insert nor the plasmid has to be pre-digested; the plasmid can be used directly from a plasmid preparation (mini or maxi scale), and the viral cDNA has to be gel-purified only once after RT-PCR.\n\n\n3.\nSince only very small amounts of DNA are required, the restriction/ligation reaction is performed with only a few units of restriction enzyme and DNA ligase, reducing the costs even further.\n\n\n4.\nThe incubation time can be as short as five minutes and still yields almost 100\u00a0% positive clones. As we demonstrated for all eight influenza virus genes, there is a very high rate of white colonies resulting from successful cloning. This large proportion of positive clones is also a major step forward in reducing the time and material used to screen for positive cloning results.\n\n\n5.\nThe one-tube reaction allows the successful cloning of genes in their full length and with the correct sequence, even if they contain internal restriction sites for the digestion enzyme used (i.e., BsmBI/Esp3I in PB2 or NA), as restriction digestion and ligation are at an equilibrium at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, which is shifted towards ligation of available ends when this reaction is further incubated at room temperature. This results in a large number of positive clones. Therefore, with our protocol, it is not necessary to consider internal restriction sites, as they are re-ligated as well, allowing the use of just one set of primers.\n\n\nOver the last few years, three new cloning techniques were published that allow rapid cloning of viral genes and do not require digestion of cDNAs, thereby circumventing the problem of internal restriction sites. The first method, published by Stech et al. [14] describes the use of viral cDNA as megaprimers for target-primed plasmid amplification. The other two groups describing rapid cloning methods base their protocols on \u201cligation-independent cloning\u201d instead, where Wang et al. [15] utilize homologous recombination of viral cDNA with modified pHH21 plasmids that harbour the conserved 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of influenza A virus gene segments. Similarly, Zhou et al. [16] introduce a technique where apparently all eight gene segments are amplified in a single \u201cmultiplex\u201d RT-PCR reaction and then inserted into a modified pHH21 vector by In-Fusion cloning (Clonetech). All of these protocols, despite accelerating the cloning process, have several drawbacks compared to our method: they either require larger amounts of cDNA and several successive PCR reactions, which may introduce unwanted mutations [14] or yield a lower ratio of positive clones in the case of larger gene segments like those of the polymerase subunits [15, 16]. Additionally, with the protocol of Zhou et al., a very large number of clones probably have to be screened in order to obtain plasmids for each of the eight gene segments. Furthermore, for the two protocols utilizing ligation-independent cloning, the vector has to be digested and purified prior to the cloning reaction, and the In-Fusion technique also requires the use of a commercial cloning kit. Therefore, our protocol is advantageous with respect to fidelity, efficiency and time and material consumption.As cloning into pHW2000 is a one-way process, successive subcloning into other plasmids such as pCAGGS is also quite time-consuming. Previously, we cut viral genes from pHW2000 with SalI and SmaI and ligated them into SmaI/XhoI-digested pCAGGS. As is already apparent, this protocol requires time and a large amount of plasmid DNA, since a small amount of DNA is lost with each purification step. Another method, adapted to the one-tube cloning reaction using pHW2000, is to generate a PCR product of the viral gene (using pHW2000 as template and the cloning primers described by Hoffmann) for ligation into our pCAGGS-blue vectors. This protocol, just as for pHW2000 requires only a few nanograms of DNA and is quite fast. To minimize the risk of PCR-based errors, we created an entry vector from which any inserted gene can be transferred to all Esp- and Bsa vectors (pHW2000-Esp-blue or pCAGGS-Esp-blue, etc.) by a simple one-tube exchange reaction following the same protocol used for direct cloning. This new vector (pEntryT) has the advantage that any viral cDNA synthesized by RT-PCR can be ligated into it without the need for enzymatic digestion [13]. As the primers used for RT-PCR contain the required Esp3I or BsaI recognition sites, these are included in the vector as well. Therefore, any gene ligated into the entry vector can be excised by Esp3I or BsaI and provides the correct overhangs for ligation into our modified pHW2000 or pCAGGS plasmids. Additionally, the entry vector is designed to be as small as possible, making site-directed mutagenesis or other modifications (e.g., attachment of tags) very easy. In this way, a library of entry vectors harboring the viral genes can be generated very fast, modified as desired, and then transferred into any expression plasmid that provides the matching overhangs.There is one commercially available TOPO TA vector that is suitable as an entry vector, pCR\u00ae8/GW/TOPO\u00ae, 2817 bp, that uses spectinomycin as resistance maker. With such a TOPO TA vector, cloning can be performed as described above within a few minutes and even blunt-end ligation of purified cDNAs with high efficiency is possible [17]. For any non-TOPO TA cloning vector like our pEntryT-vector, however, one has to consider the fact that most proof reading polymerases such as Pfu or Phusion\u00ae do not create the required A-overhangs to match the vector-based T-overhang. It is therefore necessary to include a short incubation of the PCR product with Taq polymerase and dNTPs prior to ligation as described above. As a final remark, all of the plasmids presented here, as well as the cloning protocol, have been used extensively in our lab to create either recombinant viruses of different subtypes or to perform protein studies, ensuring that the method and plasmids are working as intended.In summary, we present here an optimized protocol for the cloning and subcloning of influenza virus gene segments into pHW2000- and pCAGGS-related vectors, ready for the generation of recombinant viruses or protein expression. In addition, a novel entry vector is presented that allows TA cloning of cDNAs directly from RT-PCR and further modifications, as well as the option to subclone the inserted gene segments into any other vector harbouring the corresponding ligation sequences."}
{"text": "A novel pathogenic mechanism of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses involves hemagglutinin mediated resistance to serum innate inhibitors. \n Abstract \n In this study, the effect of innate serum inhibitors on influenza virus infection was addressed. Seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses were tested with guinea pig sera negative for antibodies against all of these viruses as evaluated by hemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralization assays. In the presence of serum inhibitors, the infection by each virus was inhibited differently as measured by the amount of viral nucleoprotein produced in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The serum inhibitors inhibited seasonal influenza A(H3N2) virus the most, while the effect was less in seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and H1N1pdm viruses. The suppression by serum inhibitors could be reduced by heat inactivation or treatment with receptor destroying enzyme. In contrast, all H5N1 strains tested were resistant to serum inhibitors. To determine which structure (hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA)) on the virus particles that provided the resistance, reverse genetics (rg) was applied to construct chimeric recombinant viruses from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8) plasmid vectors. rgPR8-H5 HA and rgPR8-H5 HANA were resistant to serum inhibitors while rgPR8-H5 NA and PR8 A(H1N1) parental viruses were sensitive, suggesting that HA of HPAI H5N1 viruses bestowed viral resistance to serum inhibition. These results suggested that the ability to resist serum inhibition might enable the viremic H5N1 viruses to disseminate to distal end organs. The present study also analyzed for correlation between susceptibility to serum inhibitors and number of glycosylation sites present on the globular heads of HA and NA. H3N2 viruses, the subtype with highest susceptibility to serum inhibitors, harbored the highest number of glycosylation sites on the HA globular head. However, this positive correlation cannot be drawn for the other influenza subtypes.\n\nCitation: Panaampon J, Ngaosuwankul N, Suptawiwat O, Noisumdaeng P, Sangsiriwut K, Siridechadilok B, et al.

While the infections by influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses are confined mostly to the upper respiratory tract, the infection caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses frequently invades lower respiratory tract, induces cytokine storm, and causes severe pneumonia which progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure [1], [2]. Dissemination of H5N1 virus beyond the respiratory tract is well documented. The viral RNA could be detected in the autopsies of several organs [3], cerebrospinal fluid [4], and fetal tissues [5]. In addition, HPAI H5N1 virus could be isolated from a plasma sample of a Thai patient [6]. This information indicates that the propensity to undergo viremic phase is not uncommon for HPAI H5N1 virus infection. On the other hand, there has been just one recent report on viremia in patients infected with the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm) virus [7]. Moreover, viremia associated with seasonal influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses is very rare [8]\u2013[10]. These findings indicate that various influenza subtypes are different in the capability to exhibit viremic phase.\nSera and respiratory fluids of mammals contain several innate soluble factors that exhibit anti-influenza activity, for examples, members of the collectin superfamily such as surfactant protein A (SP-A), surfactant protein D (SP-D), conglutinin and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) [11]\u2013[13], member of the pentraxin superfamily such as pentraxin 3 (PTX3) [14], and serum amyloid P component [15]. The binding of human SP-D and MBL to both hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) can inhibit influenza virus hemagglutinating activity, interfere with virus release through inhibition of viral neuraminidase activity, and hinder viral infection by preventing viral attachment to the cell receptor. The anti-influenza activities of human SP-D and MBL do not involve other complement factors [16]. Interestingly, the highly glycosylated seasonal H1N1 strains are sensitive to inhibition by both SP-D and MBL, while the poorly glycosylated A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8) and H1N1pdm are resistant to either one of them [17]. The long chain pentraxin, PTX3 inhibits several strains of seasonal influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses [14], though the susceptibility to PTX3 may be strain-specific as some seasonal human influenza isolates including PR8 virus and the H1N1pdm viruses are resistant to PTX3 [17]. Complement, the major component of innate immunity, may play anti-influenza activity independently or in adjunct with other components. Activation of the complement system results in virus aggregation, virolysis or opsonization [18]. It can lead to increased vascular permeability and recruitment of phagocytic cells to destroy the pathogens. MBL, together with complement in guinea pig serum, exerted lytic activity on influenza virus infected-BHK-21 cells through the classical pathway [19]. MBL also binds influenza HA and activates complement through lectin pathway [20]. Moreover, complement together with natural IgM antibody can destroy virus through the classical pathway [21].\nIn the other system, non-specific inhibitors against influenza viruses present in normal sera of various animal species were classified into three types: \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-inhibitors based on their chemical composition and several biological properties [22], [23]. \u03b1-inhibitors are heat- stable, but receptor destroying enzyme (RDE)-sensitive glycoproteins. It inhibited influenza virus hemagglutination, but not influenza virus infectivity. The examples of \u03b1-inhibitors found in serum are soluble mucoproteins. \u03b2-inhibitors are non-sialylated, Ca2+ dependent and heat-labile but RDE-resistant. Study in bovine and mouse serum suggested that MBL and SP-D belonged to \u03b2-inhibitors [24]; and MBL was serologically cross reactive with human mannose-binding protein (MBP) [20]. \u03b3-inhibitors are heat-stable and RDE-sensitive sialylated glycoproteins which compete with cellular receptor for binding with HA; these inhibitors neutralize viral infectivity by blocking the attachment step in the influenza virus replication cycle [23], [25]. In horse, guinea pig and mouse sera, \u03b3-inhibitor had been identified as \u03b12-macroglobulin [25], [26]. In addition, the study in murine model also demonstrated that the \u03b12-macroglobulin could inhibit hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, but its activity on microneutralization (microNT) assay against various viruses expressing H3N2 HA was varied among H3N2 isolates [26].\nFor the influenza viruses to exhibit viremic phase, they should be able to overcome the inhibition by innate serum inhibitors. Therefore, the ability of HPAI H5N1 viruses to spread beyond the respiratory tract is suggestive of their ability to resist the serum inhibitors. Herein, guinea pig sera were used as the model to study serum innate immunity against various influenza viruses of human and avian origins, including seasonal H1N1, H3N2, H1N1pdm, and HPAI H5N1 viruses. The nature of inhibitors was characterized by their sensitivity to heat or RDE treatment. We demonstrated that HPAI H5N1 virus was the only subtype that could resist the inactivation by serum innate inhibitors. Using reverse genetics, the viral resistance to serum inhibitors could be mapped to HA. Our finding suggested a novel pathogenic mechanism on H5N1 virus dissemination beyond the respiratory system.\n\nResults\n\nBiological properties of the guinea pig sera\nIn order to determine role of serum inhibitors against influenza viruses, it is necessary to screen that the test guinea pig sera contained no specific antibodies against the study viruses. Otherwise, it would be difficult to differentiate between inhibitory effects mediated by the serum specific inhibitors and specific antibodies. Sera of three guinea pigs from different batches of animals were screened for specific antibody against all 14 influenza virus isolates and 4 reassorted viruses by HI and microNT assays. The result showed that none of the test sera contained pre-existing HI or NT antibody as screened at the initial serum dilution 1\u223610 (data not shown).\nIt has been known that some serum innate inhibitors are heat-labile and some are heat-stable. There is no control measure to determine stability of those unknown heat-labile components in the stored sera during the on going experiments. Therefore, our study used complement as the representative of heat-labile components based on its abundant amount in guinea pig sera and availability of the measurement method. We assumed that if complement in the test sera did not deteriorate, the other heat-labile components should remain in good condition. Each guinea pig serum was measured for complement titer by complement fixation test using hemolysin sensitized-sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) as the indicator system. We also showed that the three guinea pigs used in our experiments contained comparable serum concentrations of complement, i.e., 32\u201364 complement hemolytic units; in another word, the serum dilution of 1\u223632 or 1\u223664 contained one complement hemolytic unit. The native sera and heat-inactivated sera were assayed in parallel for their lytic activity on hemolysin sensitized- SRBCs. The result demonstrated that the native sera completely lysed the sensitized-SRBCs, while the lytic activity was eradicated after heat inactivation.\nFurthermore, the sera were diluted to contain the complement concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 hemolytic units and assayed against the seasonal A(H1N1) (SI-RA-TT/04), seasonal A(H3N2) (SI 03/04), H1N1pdm (Nonth/102/09) and HPAI H5N1 (KAN-1) viruses in order to determine the optimal dilutions that could exert anti-influenza activity. The result showed a slight increase in the percentages of viral inhibition when serum complement concentrations were greater than two hemolytic units (Figure 1). Therefore, the concentration of 2 complement hemolytic units was employed in subsequent experiments.\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 1.  Anti-influenza activities of guinea pig sera at various complement hemolytic units.Native guinea pig sera at various complement hemolytic units were incubated with seasonal H1N1 (SI-RA-TT/04), H3N2 (SI 03/04), H1N1pdm (Nonth/102/09) or HPAI H5N1 (KAN-1/04) virus followed by inoculation the serum-virus mixture onto MDCK cell monolayers. After an overnight incubation, the viral inhibitory activity of the test serum was measured by determining the amount of viral nucleoprotein produced in the inoculated MDCK cells by ELISA. The results are shown as mean of the percentages of viral inhibition derived from quadruplicate experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation.\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036318.g001\n\nDetermination for activity of serum innate inhibitors against various influenza subtypes\nGuinea pig sera were used as source of innate inhibitors in the assay for infection inhibition against influenza viruses. The study viruses at concentration of 1,000 TCID50/50 \u00b5l (TCID50; 50% tissue culture infectious dose) were incubated with native guinea pig serum at working dilution which contained complement concentration of 2 hemolytic units. The virus-serum mixture in quadruplicate was inoculated onto Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers for overnight. Infectivity of the viruses which were susceptible to serum innate inhibitors should be inhibited and resulted in the decreased amount of viral nucleoprotein produced in the infected MDCK cells as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on the percentages of viral infection inhibition as compared to the virus control, H3N2 viruses were the subtype most susceptible to serum inhibitors (81\u2013100% inhibition); and followed in order by H1N1pdm (34\u201389% inhibition) and seasonal H1N1 viruses (21\u201362% inhibition) (Table 1 and Figure 2). In contrast, all HPAI H5N1 viruses were resistant to serum inhibitors with the percentages of inhibition of less than 10, except one serum which exerted 19% inhibition against KAN-1, and 12% inhibition against NBL (feces in origin) viruses (Table 1).\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 2.

Statistically significant difference in the percentage of inhibition was considered at p\u22640.05. Each serum was assayed in quadruplicate and the percentages of viral inhibition of all 3 guinea pig sera were averaged. The viral inhibition effects exerted by native sera, heat-inactivated sera and RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera are shown as the histograms in Figure 2.\nAmong H1N1 viruses (Figure 2A), PR8 virus was the most susceptible to serum inhibitors (62% viral inhibition) and followed in order by SI 3043/09 and SI-RA-TT/04. Nevertheless, the inhibitory activity against PR8 decreased to almost 4% when the viruses were treated with either heat-inactivated sera or RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera. Thus, the PR8 virus was susceptible to heat-sensitive inhibitors only, as the addition of RDE (in the RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera) did not further decrease the percentages of viral inhibitory activity. Similarly, SI 3043/09 was also inhibited by native serum; and percentages of viral inhibition decreased from 31% to 15% with heat-inactivated sera, and to 12% with RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera. As the decrease in the percentages of inhibition from 15 to 12% was not statistically significant, it is interpreted that SI 3043/09 was susceptible to heat-labile inhibitors, but susceptibility to RDE-sensitive inhibitors, if any, should be very minute. On the other hand, SI-RA-TT/04 was susceptible to both heat-sensitive inhibitors and RDE-sensitive inhibitors as the percentages of viral inhibition dropped from 21% to 13% or 1% after treatment with heat-inactivated sera or RDE-treated+inactivated sera, respectively.\nAmong H1N1pdm (Figure 2B), percentages of inhibition of Thai/104/09 virus as assayed against native sera, heat-inactivated sera and RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera were 34, 15 and 5%, respectively. This result showed that Thai/104/09 virus was susceptible to heat-labile serum inhibitors; however, its susceptibility to RDE-sensitive inhibitors could not be drawn statistically. On the other hand, percentages of inhibition of Nonth/102/09 virus as assayed with native sera, heat-inactivated sera and RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera were 84, 81 and 42%, respectively. The data suggested that Nonth/102/09 virus was partially susceptible to RDE-sensitive inhibitors. The percentages of viral inhibition of CA/07/09 virus as assayed with native sera, heat-inactivated sera and RDE-treated+heat-inactivated were 89, 74, and 8%, respectively. The result suggested that CA/07/09 virus was slightly susceptible to heat-labile inhibitors, but highly susceptible to RDE-sensitive inhibitors.\nInterestingly, all H3N2 viruses were highly susceptible to native serum with percentages of viral inhibition greater than 80% (Figure 2C). SI 08/98, SI 06/02 and SI 02/03 were susceptible to both heat-labile inhibitors and RDE-sensitive inhibitors. Such that the percentages of viral inhibition dropped from 81 to 5% for SI 08/98, from 100 to 20% for SI 06/02, and from 96 to 49% for SI 02/03, as the results obtained from the assays with native sera were compared with those employed heat-inactivated sera; and also, the percentages of viral inhibition dropped from 5 to 0% for SI 08/98, from 20 to 0% for SI 06/02, and from 49 to 3% for SI 02/03, as the results obtained from the assay with heat-inactivated sera were compared with those employed RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera. The statistical analyses were significantly different for those comparisons. On the other hand, SI 03/04 was susceptible to heat-labile inhibitors alone as shown by the significant decrease in the percentages of viral inhibition from 97 to 22% as the assays with native sera were compared with those employed heat-inactivated sera. In contrast, the percentages of viral inhibition which decreased from 22% (as assayed with heat-inactivated sera) to 12% (as assayed with RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera) was not significantly different.\nOwing to low susceptibility of the HPAI H5N1 viruses to native guinea pig sera (the mean percentage of viral inhibition of 11, 3, 10, 6, and 4 for KAN-1, 676(NYK), NBL feces, NBL lung, and Nong Khai 1, respectively), the assays employing heat-inactivated serum as well as RDE-treated+heat-inactivated serum were not performed.\n\n\nRole of HA on viral resistance to serum innate inhibitors\nOwing to the difference in susceptibility to serum innate inhibitors among various influenza subtypes, it is speculated that HA and/or NA play a key role in this difference. To elucidate this speculation, reassorted PR8 virus together with three reverse genetic viruses harboring HA and/or NA genes from HPAI H5N1 (KAN-1) viruses in PR8 backbone, i.e., rgPR8-H5 HANA (6+2 virus), rgPR8-H5 HA (7+1 virus), and rgPR8-H5 NA (7+1 virus) were tested against guinea pig sera. The result showed that reassorted PR8 parental virus and rgPR8-H5 NA could be inhibited by serum innate inhibitors with 48\u201362% and 42\u201385% viral inhibition, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, rgPR8-H5 HA and rgPR8-H5 HANA could resist the serum inhibitors with percentages of viral inhibition of only 0\u20135% for rgPR8-H5 HA and 2\u20137% for rgPR8-H5 HANA, similarly to the H5N1 wild type viruses. When the viral inhibitory activity of native serum, heat-inactivated serum and RDE-treated+heat-inactivated serum were compared, the result showed that efficiency to inhibit reassorted PR8 parental virus and rgPR8-H5 NA viruses were almost completely lost simply by heat inactivation alone; and thus, the inhibitory effect from RDE could not be seen (Figure 3). No significant change in percentages of viral inhibition was observed with rgPR8-H5 HA and rgPR8-H5 HANA viruses when reacted with either heat-inactivated serum or RDE-treated+heat-inactivated serum. The results were reproducible with all three guinea pig serum samples tested (Table 1). In conclusion, it was the HA not NA that rendered HPAI H5N1 viruses the resistance to serum inhibitors.\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 3.

Additionally, previous groups of investigators reported that an increase in glycosylation site in HA protein resulted in the increased susceptibility to innate inhibitory factors such as SP-D and collectins [27], [28]. Therefore, our study viruses were predicted for their potential sites of glycosylation in HA and NA molecules by CountGS application in BioEdit program version 7.0.4.1 [29]. HA and NA sequences of the study viruses are retrieved from the GenBank database using the accession numbers as shown in Table 2. The potential N-linked glycosylation motif was defined as Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X may represent any amino acids except proline. The present study determined number of glycosylation sites in the HA globular head of the study viruses, defining that the globular head is situated between the loop region flanked with a conserved disulfide bond in the cysteine bridge in HA1 domain [30]. With methionine as the start position, the globular heads are situated between amino acid position 59 to 291 (reassorted PR8 and seasonal H1N1 viruses), 59 to 292 (H1N1pdm viruses), 68 to 293 (seasonal H3N2 viruses), and 58 to 290 (HPAI H5N1 viruses).\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageTable 2.  Potential glycosylation sites on HA and NA proteins of the study viruses.\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036318.t002The results showed that H3N2 viruses, the most susceptible subtype to serum inhibitors, contained highest number of glycosylation sites in HA. On the other hand, reassorted PR8 and H1N1pdm viruses which were moderately susceptible to serum innate inhibitors contained one glycosylation site on the HA globular head, while the resistant H5N1 viruses harbored 2 glycosylation sites (Table 2). A homology-based structural model of the HA molecules of seasonal H1N1 (SI-RA-TT/04), H1N1pdm (Thai/104/09), seasonal H3N2 (SI 03/04) and HPAI H5N1 (KAN-1) viruses were constructed using HA crystal structures of PR8, A/California/04/09, A/X-31 (H3N2) or A/HK/212/03 (H5N1) (PDB codes: 1RU7, 3LZG, 1HGF and 3FKU, respectively) as the template. All three-dimensional models are generated by Chimera program version 1.5.3 [31] as shown in Figure 4. Amino acid positions that are the potential N-linked glycosylation sites on globular head of HA were predicted for reasserted PR8 (Asn285), seasonal H1N1 (Asn71, Asn104, Asn142 and Asn176), H1N1pdm (Asn104), seasonal H3N2 (Asn79, Asn138, Asn142, Asn149, Asn160, Asn181 and Asn262, but Asn160 was not found in SI 08/98 (H3N2)), and H5N1 (Asn170 and Asn181).\n\n          Download:\n          PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFigure 4.

Based on NA crystal structures of A/Brevig Mission/1/18 (H1N1) and A/Memphis/31/98 (H3N2) (PDB codes: 3BEQ and 2AEP, respectively) with methionine as the start position, the globular head domain of N1 NA starts at position 83 to 468 (N1 numbering) and that of N2 NA starts at position 82 to 469 (N2 numbering). Amino acid positions that are the potential N-linked glycosylation sites on globular head of NA were predicted for reassorted PR8 (Asn88 and Asn235), seasonal H1N1 (Asn88, Asn146, Asn235, Asn434 and Asn455), H1N1pdm (Asn88, Asn146, Asn235 and Asn385), seasonal H3N2 (Asn86, Asn146, Asn200, Asn234, Asn392 and Asn402, but additional site, Asn93, was found in SI 06/02), and H5N1 viruses (Asn126, Asn215, but additional site, Asn321, was found in 676(NYK), and Asn366 was found in Nong Khai 1 virus).\n\n\nDiscussionMost of human sera contain pre-existing anti-influenza antibodies as the results of vaccinations or past infections with some influenza subtypes. Therefore, guinea pig sera instead of human sera were used as the model to study innate immunity against influenza viruses in order to avoid interference effect from human specific antibody which might create miss-interpretation in the viral infection inhibition assay. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the serum components such as MBL and SP-D are presented in both guinea pig and human sera [11]\u2013[13]. To some extents and with a careful interpretation, our results from guinea pig should be able to extrapolate to humans. Additionally, to ascertain that the guinea pig sera were also free from anti-influenza antibodies, the sera were tested negative against all study viruses at the screening dilution of 1\u223610 by HI and microNT assays.\nOur viral infection inhibition assay demonstrated that among 10 human influenza viruses (reassorted PR8, 2 seasonal H1N1, 4 seasonal H3N2 and 3 H1N1pdm viruses) tested, 5 were susceptible to both heat-inactivated sera and RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera, 4 were susceptible to heat-inactivated sera only and 1 was susceptible to RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera only, with degree of inhibition varying to virus subtypes and strains within the same subtype. H3N2 subtype was the most susceptible to serum inhibitors, while seasonal H1N1 and H1N1pdm viruses were moderately susceptible. All HPAI H5N1 isolates tested were highly resistant to serum inhibitors. While the identities of the serum inhibitors were not determined in our study, the class of serum innate immunity could be estimated from the viral inhibition effects after the sera were treated with heat or RDE+heat. Since \u03b1-inhibitors can inhibit only hemagglutination but not virus infection [22], [23], they are likely not contributing to the virus inhibition observed in our experiments. On the other hand, our results suggested that serum innate inhibitors against the non H5N1 influenza viruses could be \u03b2-inhibitors which are heat-labile and RDE-resistant, \u03b3-inhibitors which are heat-stable and RDE-sensitive, and complement which is heat-labile.\nWhile most of investigators utilized individual serum factors such as SP-D, SP-A, MBL or PTX-3 to study influenza innate immunity, serum factors are likely to work together to exert their anti-influenza activities. In addition, there might be several more anti-influenza factors in sera that have not been discovered yet; thus, complicating the interpretation of the results in broader picture of pathogenesis. The activity of individual factor may not represent overall inhibitory activity observed in the native serum. For example, investigators previously reported that PR8 virus was resistant to MBL [17], and SP-D [27]; however, the present study demonstrated that our reassorted PR8 virus was sensitive to native guinea pig sera with 48\u201362% viral inhibition activity. The effect of reverse genetics manipulation on susceptibility to serum inhibitors has been excluded as our rgPR8-H5 NA was sensitive while rgPR8-H5 HA and rgPR8-H5 HANA were resistant to the serum inhibitors. Therefore, our system of using whole serum to examine anti-influenza innate serum inhibitors provides a suitable platform to dissect how the HPAI H5N1 virus could disseminate to distal organs.\nNumber of glycosylation sites on the envelope glycoprotein, HA in particular, has been correlated to the susceptibility of influenza viruses to innate serum inhibitors [28]. Our study showed that H3N2, the most susceptible subtype, has the highest number of glycosylation sites on HA as compared to the other virus subtypes, with 11\u201312 sites on the H3N2 complete HA amino acid sequences and 6\u20137 sites on the globular head. A previous study demonstrated that high degree of N-linked glycosylation could attenuate H3N2 influenza viruses. The addition of oligosaccharide moieties to globular head of HA had been linked to increased sensitivity of H3N2 viruses to SP-D and MBL [32]. Glycosylation sites on HA have accumulated in the human influenza H3N2 virus since its appearance in 1968. This gain of sites and their long-term maintenance are presumed to be due to a selective advantage of glycosylation [33]. Extensive evidences indicated that glycosylation plays important roles in the life cycle of influenza viruses by conferring structural integrity and stability of virus particles as well as modulating the functions of HA and NA in the recognition of host cell receptors, in particular [34]. Mannose-containing oligosaccharides on the virus envelope were shown to be a target for recognition and destruction by lectins of the innate immune system [35]. Based on the data obtained from H3N2 viruses, it is likely that the degree of viral neutralizing activity of our guinea pig sera was positively correlated to number of glycosylation sites present on HA globular head. Nevertheless, our data from other human influenza subtypes does not support this hypothesis. Our reassorted PR8 and H1N1pdm viruses, which are moderately susceptible to serum inhibitors, contain only one glycosylation site on the HA globular head; while HPAI H5N1 viruses, which are the most resistant subtype, contain two sites. These findings suggested that the viral domains other than glycosylation sites on HA globular head could be the target for binding with serum innate inhibitors. In addition, our previous work also suggested that receptor binding site might not be the target of recognition by the serum inhibitors as 676(NYK) which preferred human type receptor (sialic acid-linked \u03b12,6-galactose) was as resistant as the other H5N1 isolates which preferred avian type receptor (sialic acid-linked \u03b12,3-galactose) [36].\nPrevious studies have shown genetic elements that contribute to the H5N1 viral virulence such as glutamine to lysine substitution at amino acid position 627 in PB2, the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, and the presence of a sequence motif, Glu-Ser-Glu-Val at the carboxyl terminus of NS1 protein [37]. Herein, our study suggests a novel mechanism to virulence of HPAI H5N1 viruses through their ability to resist serum innate immunity, enabling the viruses to disseminate beyond the respiratory tract, the primary organ of infection, to various visceral organs. The disseminated viruses may subsequently exert their immunopathological effect via an induction of cytokine storm and multi-organ failure, the hallmarks of HPAI H5N1 in humans.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nGuinea pig sera\nGuinea pig blood was purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Mahidol University. When the blood clot retracted, serum was separated by spinning at 2,000 rpm in a refrigerated centrifuge, and then aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Guinea pig sera were negative for antibody to all study influenza viruses as determined by HI and microNT assays.\n\n\nThe viruses\nInfluenza A viruses in this study including seasonal H1N1 and H3N2, H1N1pdm and HPAI H5N1 viruses (Table 1), were propagated in MDCK cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection; CCL-34). These virus isolates were kindly provided by Siriraj Influenza Cooperative Research Center; and the routine service laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.\n\n\nConstruction of influenza reassortants by reverse genetics\nThe pHW reverse genetic system [38] comprising 8 recombinant plasmids containing PA, PB1, PB2, NP, HA, NA, M or NS genomic segments derived from the parental PR8 virus were kindly provided by Prof. Robert Webster and Dr. Erich Hoffman, St. Jude Children Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Three kinds of reverse genetic viruses harboring HA, NA, or both HA and NA genes derived from A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 (H5N1) viruses were constructed. HA and NA genomic segments were amplified by RT-PCR using universal primers [39] and cloned individually into pHW2000 vector. HA segment (accession number AY555150) was engineered to eliminate the multiple basic amino acids at HA cleavage site (337-PQRERRRKKR-346 was changed to 337-PQ----IETR-346, H5 numbering) which mimics the cleavage site of the low pathogenic avian H6 virus before cloning; while the NA segment (accession number AY555151) was cloned unmodified. To construct the reverse genetic viruses, rgPR8-H5 HA (7+1), rgPR8-H5 NA (7+1) and rgPR8-H5 HANA (6+2) viruses, 1 \u00b5g of each of the 8 recombinant plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells co-culturing with MDCK cells using TransIT\u00ae-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI). After 24 hours, the reassortants were rescued by adding with 1 ml of Opti-MEM\u00ae I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 2 \u00b5g/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The culture plate was further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24\u201348 hours, observed for cytopathic effect and screened for progeny viruses released in the culture supernatant by hemagglutination assay. In addition, all 8 pHW recombinant plasmids containing each gene of PR8 origin were transfected into HEK-293 cells co-culturing with MDCK cells to generate reassorted PR8 virus as the control of the experiments. The reassortants were propagated and titrated in MDCK cells.\n\n\nHI assay\nHI assay was performed based on the protocol as described in the WHO manual [40]. Goose RBCs were employed in the assay for antibody to HPAI H5N1 and H1N1pdm. On the other hand guinea pig RBCs were employed in the assay for antibody to the other human influenza viruses. Briefly, 50 \u00b5l of guinea pig serum was mixed with 150 \u00b5l of RDE (Denka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16\u201318 hours to eliminate the nonspecific inhibitors. The treated serum was inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and absorbed with the test RBCs to remove nonspecific agglutinators. The replicating influenza virus at the final concentration of 4 hemagglutination units/25 \u00b5l was used as the test antigen. The treated serum was serially two-fold diluted at an initial dilution of 1\u223610 into a final volume of 25 \u00b5l per well before 25 \u00b5l of the test antigen was added. After incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes, 50 \u00b5l of 0.5% goose RBCs (for HI antibody to H1N1pdm and H5N1 viruses) or 0.75% guinea pig RBCs (for HI antibody to seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses) were added into every well and further incubated the reaction plate at 4\u00b0C 30 minutes (for goose RBCs) or 60 minutes (for guinea pig RBCs). HI titer was defined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution that completely inhibited hemagglutination of RBCs.\n\n\nMicroNT assay\nGuinea pig sera were screened for the antibodies to the test influenza viruses by microNT assay using the protocol as described previously [40]. Guinea pig serum was treated with RDE before heat inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The treated sera were serially two- fold diluted with 1X EMEM at an initial dilution of 1\u223610 in a microtiter plate. The diluted serum was incubated with the test virus at the final concentration of 100 TCID50/100 \u00b5l for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Then, 100 \u00b5l of each virus-antibody mixture was transferred onto the MDCK cell monolayer maintained in EMEM supplemented with trypsin TPCK (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. The inoculated MDCK cell monolayers in the reaction plates were fixed with 80% acetone prior to determining for presence of viral nucleoprotein by ELISA. Antibody titer was defined as the highest serum dilution that yielded a 50% reduction in the amount of nucleoprotein as compared to the virus infected cell control.\n\n\nComplement titration\nGuinea pig serum contains many soluble factors, including complement factors that confer activity against influenza virus. The amount of complement present in each guinea pig serum can be measured by titration against hemolysin-sensitized SRBCs [41]. Equal volume of 2% SRBCs was mixed with appropriate concentration of hemolysin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hour with shaking at intervals to obtain hemolysin sensitized SRBCs. The test guinea pig serum was serially two-fold diluted with veronal buffer to obtain a volume of 25 \u00b5l per well in a U-shaped microtiter plate. Then, the serum was incubated with hemolysin sensitized SRBCs for 45 minutes with shaking at intervals. In the presence of serum complement, the sensitized SRBCs would be lysed; while the SRBCs and sensitized SRBC controls appeared as a red button at the bottom of the well. One hemolytic unit was defined as the highest dilution of complement which yielded complete hemolysis of the sensitized SRBCs. Owing to heat-labile nature of the complement proteins, guinea pig sera were stored at \u221270\u00b0C; and complement titration was conducted prior to each use.\n\n\nAssay for inhibition of influenza virus infection by soluble factors in guinea pig serum\nGuinea pig serum at the working concentration of 2 complement hemolytic units was incubated with the test virus at a final concentration of 1,000 TCID50/50 \u00b5l at 37\u00b0C for 45 minutes in quadruplicate wells. Then, the mixtures were transferred onto MDCK cell monolayers and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C prior to measuring the amount of viral nucleoprotein in the infected MDCK cell monolayers by ELISA. In the presence of serum inhibitors, viral infection was blocked, resulting in the decreased amount of viral nucleoprotein synthesized in the inoculated culture as compared to the infected MDCK cell controls. In the case where serum inhibitors could not inhibit viral infection, the high O.D. values indicating viral nucleoprotein synthesis would be observed. The percentages of viral inhibition were calculated based on the O.D. values as compared to the virus control without serum.\nThe assay employed native guinea pig serum was conducted in parallel with the heat-inactivated serum and together with the RDE-treated+heat-inactivated serum. Heat treatment to inactivate the \u03b2-inhibitors was performed by treating the guinea pig serum at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then cooled on ice. RDE treatment was conducted to destroy \u03b1- and \u03b3-inhibitors such that the guinea pig serum was mixed with RDE according to the protocol used for HI assay, followed by heat inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes to get rid of RDE activity and \u03b2-inhibitors.\n\n\nELISA\nELISA for influenza viral nucleoprotein was performed with mouse specific monoclonal antibody against influenza nucleoprotein (Catalog number MAB8257, Millipore Corporation, Temecula, CA) as the primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Catalog number 1010-05, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) was used as the secondary antibody. The optical density was measured at dual wavelengths of 450/630 in a spectrophotometer.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was done with PASW Statistics 18 software. The percentages of viral inhibition by native sera, heat-inactivated sera and RDE-treated+heat-inactivated sera were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Difference between two data sets was examined using Student's t-test. The significance level was set at p\u22640.05.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Miss Malinee Chittaganpitch, the National Influenza Reference Laboratory, National Institute of Health, Department of Medical Science, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand for influenza strain identification.\nAuthor ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: P.

{"text": "Influenza A virus molecular virology techniques. \n Abstract \n Molecular biological techniques for genomic analysis and for creation of recombinant viruses are critical tools in our efforts to understand and combat influenza A viruses. These molecular virology approaches are used in diagnostics, basic research, molecular epidemiology, bioinformatics, and vaccine development. The majority of the techniques used to study this segmented negative-sense RNA virus begin by purifying RNA from the virus, or infected cells, and converting it to cDNA, then to dsDNA, and amplifying that dsDNA using reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). The RTPCR amplicons can be probed, sequenced, or cloned into a variety of vectors for further analysis and to create recombinant influenza A viruses by plasmid-based reverse genetics. To accelerate the amplification and cloning process, we developed multi-segment-RTPCR (M-RTPCR) techniques that efficiently amplify the eight genomic viral RNA segments (vRNAs) of influenza A virus in a single reaction, irrespective of the virus strain. The M-RTPCR amplicons are ideal for nucleotide sequence analysis and cloning full-length vRNAs into plasmids or other vectors designed for protein expression or reverse genetics. Therefore, we also developed modified reverse-genetics plasmids that are designed to rapidly clone M-RTPCR products, or other full-length vRNA amplicons, using recombination-based techniques. The combination of M-RTPCR and recombination-based cloning confers sensitivity, speed, fidelity, and flexibility to the analysis and rescue of any strain/subtype of influenza A virus, without the need for in vitro propagation. The specific topics described in this chapter include purification of high-quality viral RNA, genomic amplification using two different M-RTPCR schemes, sequencing vRNA amplicons, and cloning vRNA amplicons into our modified reverse-genetics plasmids, or commercially available plasmids.Key wordsInfluenza A virusRTPCR amplificationM-RTPCRCloningRecombinationLigase independentReverse geneticsSequencing\n\n\n\nAccess provided by North East Research Libraries\n\nDownload protocol PDF\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpringer Nature is developing a new tool to find and evaluate Protocols.\u00a0Learn more\n\n\n1 IntroductionThe influenza A virus genome (\u223c13.5 kb) is composed of eight negative-sense vRNAs that range in size from 0.89 to 2.3 kb and encode up to 11 proteins (1). Influenza A virus diagnostics, bioinformatics/genomic analysis, basic research, and vaccine creation by reverse genetics are all facilitated by a variety of molecular virology techniques. These techniques include the purification of high-quality vRNA, RTPCR procedures that convert the vRNAs to dsDNAs and amplify the dsDNA, cloning RTPCR amplicons for a variety of downstream applications (e.g., sequencing, protein expression, or reverse genetics), and methods that enable rapid nucleotide sequence analysis. Although a plethora of approaches for RTPCR amplification and/or detection of a specific vRNA, or small regions within a vRNA, have been developed, the extensive sequence diversity found among influenza A viruses hindered the development of a single method for the full-length amplification of the eight vRNAs that compose the viral genome.A few approaches have been developed for single-reaction genomic amplification (2\u20134) or for rapid cloning into reverse-genetics plasmids (5, 6). These powerful techniques (2\u20136) represent significant advances that have improved influenza A virus vRNA amplification, cloning, and reverse genetics; however, each has limitations such as the need to multiplex many different oligonucleotide primers or require at least eight separate RTPCR reaction vessels. Although we strongly encourage people to read these papers, the primary topics covered in this chapter are recently developed techniques that enable the amplification of the entire genome of any influenza A virus in a single RTPCR reaction, and the subsequent use of these amplicons either for nucleotide sequencing or for cloning into commercially available plasmids, or modified reverse-genetics plasmids to rapidly create recombinant influenza viruses (7). M-RTPCR is a very robust method that can be used for historic, contemporary, or novel emerging strains of influenza A virus, regardless of their diverse genotypes. Some of the advantages of M-RTPCR include (1) prior sequence information is not required; (2) 1 primer set amplifies the entire segmented genome in a single reaction; (3) genomic amplification directly from swab specimens, which provides more accurate sequence information and clones that are free from artifacts selected by virus propagation in the laboratory; (4) its ideally suited for high-throughput DNA sequencing and array platforms; (5) could be a valuable method in the field, because different subtypes/strains/reassortants can be identified easily by differences in the mobility of amplicons in standard agarose gel electrophoresis; (6) provides a universal platform to speed cloning into reverse-genetics plasmids or other vectors (e.g., protein expression). We describe two different primer sets that are optimized for efficient genomic amplification by M-RTPCR. One primer set was designed for sequencing or cloning of the amplicons into commercial plasmids and the other set was primarily designed for cloning into modified reverse-genetics plasmids. We modified a 12-plasmid-based reverse-genetics plasmid (pHH21 (8)) and a bidirectional 8-plasmid-based reverse-genetics plasmid (pDZ (9)) to facilitate cloning of full-length vRNA amplicons produced by M-RTPCR (or other approaches) via ligase-independent in vitro recombination (we refer to Chapter 12 for a detailed discussion of reverse-genetics approaches). Similar modifications could be made to any reverse-genetics plasmid or other vectors to accelerate cloning of influenza A virus vRNAs.2 Materials2.1 Purification of Viral RNA\n\n\n1.\nRNeasy Mini Kit, catalog # 74104 (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA); if using the kit for the first time add ethanol to buffer RPE as described by the manufacturer.\n\n\n2.\nAdditional RNase-free 1.5-ml snap-cap centrifuge tubes.\n\n\n3.\nMolecular biology grade ethanol (100%).\n\n\n4.\nBiosafety cabinet for working with infectious materials (e.g., virus cultures).\n\n\n5.\nRefrigerated microcentrifuge at 4\u00b0C is recommended.\n\n\n2.2 Influenza A Virus Genomic Amplification by Multi-segment RTPCR\n\n\n1.\nSuperscript III HF RT-PCR kit catalog # 12574-035 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\n\n2.\nMake 10 \u03bcM stocks of the oligonucleotide primers for your use only (see Note 1).\nMBTuni primer set (see Note 2):(a) MBTuni-125\u2032-ACGCGTGATCAGC\nA\nAAAGCAGG-3\u2032(b) MBTuni-12.45\u2032-ACGCGTGATCAGC\nG\nAAAGCAGG-3\u2032(c) MBTuni-135\u2032-ACGCGTGATCAGTAGAAACAAGG-3\u2032\nUni/Inf primer set (see Note 3):(d) Uni12/Inf-15\u2032-GGGGGGAGC\nA\nAAAGCAGG 3\u2032(e) Uni12/Inf-35\u2032-GGGGGGAGC\nG\nAAAGCAGG-3\u2032(f) Uni13/Inf-15\u2032-CGGGTTATTAGTAGAAACAAGG-3\u2032\nThe region of primers that is complimentary to influenza A virus vRNA or full-length positive sense RNAs is underlined.\n\n\n\n3.\nAliquot the 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer, primers, and enzyme mix into RNase-free tubes which will be for individual use only.\n\n\n4.\nTemperature cycler.\n\n\n5.\nRNase-free, DEPC-treated water.\n\n\n6.\nMolecular biology grade ethanol (100%).\n\n\n7.\nRNase-free 0.2-ml PCR tubes or plates.\n\n\n2.3 Purification of Amplicons for Nucleotide Sequencing or Cloning\n\n\n1.\nQIAquick PCR purification kit catalog # 28104 (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).\n\n\n2.\nSodium acetate, 3 M, pH 5.0, filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm membrane.\n\n\n3.\nMicrocentrifuge.\n\n\n2.4 Sanger Sequencing of M-RTPCR Amplicons\n\n\n1.\nVirus strain-specific primers.\n\n\n2.\nAccess to institutional DNA sequencing core or commercial provider.\n\n\n3.\nDNase-free 1.5-ml snap-cap tubes.\n\n\n2.5 Cloning of M-RTPCR Amplicons into Reverse-Genetics Plasmids by Recombination-Based Cloning Techniques\n\n\n1.\nQIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit catalog # 27106 (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).\n\n\n2.\n\nPstI-HF restriction endonuclease catalog # R3140S (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).\n\n\n3.\nIn-Fusion Advantage PCR Cloning Kit catalog # 639620 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA).\n\n\n4.\nBuffer TE (pH 8.0).\n\n\n5.\nOne Shot TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli catalog # C4040-03 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\n\n6.\n37\u00b0C Heat block/incubator (shaking preferred).\n\n\n7.\n42\u00b0C Water bath/heat block (water bath preferred).\n\n\n8.\n10-cm Diameter LB agar plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin.\n\n\n9.\nS.O.C. broth.\n\n\n10.\nIce bucket with wet ice.\n\n\n2.6 TOPO TA Cloning Influenza Virus Amplicons\n\n\n1.\nTOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, e.g., pcDNA\u21223.3-TOPO\u00ae TA Cloning Kit catalog # K8300-01).

There are many RNA isolation kits and \u201chome-brews\u201d available to choose from, and most of these can be successfully employed for the isolation of high-quality RNA. In fact, it is the laboratory researchers\u2019 attention to detail and maintenance of an RNase-free environment that is critical for RTPCR of genomic-length fragments. That being said, we find that the use of QIAGEN products for low- to high-throughput RNA extraction work well, and we recommend using Qiamp vRNA extraction kit or RNeasy RNA extraction kit because they offer the most reproducible results for multiple researchers that have different sources of virus-containing starting material. This section focuses on the RNeasy extraction procedure as it is very simple and works well for the isolation of viral RNA from tissue culture supernatants, allantoic fluid, or primary swab specimens, and it can be used for low-, medium-, and high-throughput procedures (see Note 4).3.1.1 Important Factors for RNA Purification3.1.1.1 Avoid Contamination\n\n\nMost downstream techniques employ very sensitive PCR procedures so extreme care should be used to avoid DNA contamination of the tubes, solutions, etc.\n\n\nIf possible work in a dedicated \u201cclean-BSC\u201d within a clean room in which nucleic acid isolation is conducted, but the use of PCR amplification products, plasmids, and/or virus amplification is avoided.\n\n\nClean the bench area and replace any bench liners in preparation for noninfectious work. (Recommend 1\u201310% bleach, followed by 70% ETOH).\n\n\nRNases are stabile, ubiquitous, and on our skin so use gloves (recommend nitrile).\n\n\nUse RNase/DNase-free tubes and handle them as little as possible.\n\n\nLabel all RNA isolation and plasticware containers so all members of lab are aware to keep these items free of contaminating RNases or nucleic acids (e.g., RNA only, recommend storing tubes and other plasticware in the original containers that each user individually controls).\n\n\nPour tubes from bag or beaker onto saran wrap, pickup, close lid, label, and rack.\n\n\nUse filter tips for pipetting.\n\n\nUse dedicated tube openers to open microcentrifuge tubes, rather than hands.\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Other Points for Consideration\n\n\n\nBiosafety. Influenza viruses are human and animal pathogens that are transmitted via aerosols and direct contact, so always work with infectious virus in a certified biosafety cabinet using appropriate personal protective equipment and precautions.\n\n\nCheck off protocol steps when they are completed.\n\n\nAlways setup an extraction negative control(s) to identify contamination.\n\n\nRead through RNA cleanup protocol, pg 56 RNeasy mini Handbook (version 04/2006). Follow safety guidelines for reagents and solutions (Buffer RLT contains high concentration of guanidine salt).3.1.2 RNA Purification Procedure\n\n\n1.\nAliquot enough RLT for the total number of RNA purifications being done into a 50-ml conical tube (e.g., 3.6 ml for 9 samples and 1 negative control).\n\n\n2.\nAdd 350 \u03bcl of RLT to each labeled individual snap-cap tube.\n\n\n3.\nAdd 100 \u03bcl of virus-containing allantoic fluid, culture supernatant, or swab specimen and pipette five times to mix (If you have less than 100 \u03bcl, adjust the volume up to a final of 100 \u03bcl using RNase-free ddH\n\n2\n\nO).\n\n\n4.\nCap and mix well and incubate 5\u201310 min at room temperature.\n\n\n5.\nSetup RNeasy Mini spin columns in 2-ml collection tubes (supplied) in a stable rack (make sure to label the column appropriately).\n\n\n6.\nAdd 250 \u03bcl molecular biology grade ethanol (100%) to the diluted RNA, and mix well by pipetting eight times, and transfer the sample (\u223c700 \u03bcl) immediately to the spin columns placed in a 2-ml collection tube (setup in step 5).\n\n\n7.\nClose the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s at 8,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g. Discard the flow-through and return spin column to the same collection tube. (Note: After centrifugation, carefully remove the RNeasy spin column from the collection tube so that the column does not contact the flow-through. Initial centrifugation should be done at (20\u00b0C) and elution should be done at 4\u00b0C).\n\n\n\n8.\nAdd 500 \u03bcl Buffer RPE to the spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge for 15 s at 8,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g. Discard the flow-through.\n\n\n9.\nAdd 500 \u03bcl Buffer RPE to the spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge for 2 min at 8,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g.\n\n\n10.\nPlace the RNeasy spin column into a new 2-ml collection tube (supplied in kit), and discard the old collection tube with the flow-through.\n\n\n11.\nClose the lid and centrifuge at maximum speed (12,000\u201316,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g) for 1 min.\n\n\n12.\nCarefully remove the column after centrifugation and place the RNeasy spin column into a new 1.5-ml collection tube (supplied in kit).\n\n\n13.\nAdd 30 \u03bcl RNase-free water to the center of the spin column membrane. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000\u201316,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g at 20\u201325\u00b0C to elute the vRNA. (The caps of the tubes are likely to break off during this step, so be prepared to transfer the eluted RNA to a new well-labeled tube).\n\n\n14.\nKeep these tubes at 4\u00b0C or on ice while working in the lab and store the RNA at \u221280\u00b0C for future use. (The RNA concentration is usually so low that the spectrophotometer is not useful for determining the concentration).\n\n\n3.2 Influenza A Virus Genomic Amplification by Multi-segment RT-PCRThis section describes the use of M-RTPCR to simultaneously amplify the complete genome using 1 set of three oligonucleotide primers (7). There are two sets of primers (3 primers/set) that have been optimized for efficient M-RTPCR. These 5\u2032-tailed primers are complimentary to the conserved 5\u2032- and 3\u2032 termini of each vRNA segment, which base pair to form the promoters for influenza virus RNA transcription and replication.3.2.1 Important Factors\nAvoiding contamination\n\nAs discussed for RNA purification, PCR procedures are very sensitive and once a lab begins to use M-RTPCR, amplicons and clones of all influenza A virus vRNAs are being processed throughout the workspace. Therefore, unidirectional workflow should be strongly considered. Keep reaction setup areas of the laboratory separate from analysis and cloning areas.\n\n\nVirtually all other considerations listed for RNA purification are also applicable for RTPCR.\n\n\nKeep primer stocks and reagents well maintained (proper storage etc.) and free from contamination.\n\n\n3.2.2 M-RTPCR Procedure\n\n\n1.\nIsolate the influenza RNA from 100 \u03bcl of allantoic fluid, tissue culture supernatant, or swab material as described in Subheading 3.1, or thaw on ice if stored at \u221280 (see Note 5).\n\n\n2.\nThaw either the MBTuni or the Uni/Inf primer set (described in Subheadings 2 and 4).\n\n\n3.\nThaw Superscript III HF RT-PCR reagents and mix by vortexing (except for the enzyme), then place on ice.\n\n\n4.\nDetermine the volume of RNA (usually use 2.5 or 5 \u03bcl) to be used per reaction, the volume of DEPC-treated water to be added to the master mix, and the volume of master mix to be added to each tube from the total reaction volume (typically a 25 \u03bcl reaction is sufficient for cloning and one should double the volumes below for 50 \u03bcl reactions for subsequent sequencing).Typical reaction planning example for a total reaction volume of 25.0 \u03bcl:If the volume of RNA per M-RTPCR reaction tube is 2.5 \u03bclThen volume of DEPC-treated ddH2O added to Master Mix should be 8.5 \u03bclAnd the volume of Master Mix (per tube) should be 22.5 \u03bcl\n\n\n5.\nMake up the Master Mix on ice. Add H2O first and the enzyme last.Typical master mix example using Uni/Inf primer set (see\nNote\n6):Per reactionTotal volume for 25 reactions8.5 \u03bcl DEPC-treated ddH2O12.5 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer0.20 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcM Uni-12/Inf10.30 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcM Uni-12/Inf30.5 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcM Uni-13/Inf10.5 \u03bcl RT/HiFi enzyme mix212.5 \u03bcl DEPC ddH2O312.5 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer5.0 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcM7.5 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcM12.5 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcM12.5 \u03bcl RT/HiFi enzyme mix\n\n\n6.\nAdd 22.5 \u03bcl of Master Mix to 24 PCR tubes (0.2 ml) at 4\u00b0C (see Note 7).\n\n\n7.\nAdd 2.5 \u03bcl of RNA template (including negative RNA purification control) or ddH2O (PCR negative control) to tubes (see Note 8).\nMake sure to record which tube # corresponds to each sample in your notebook.\n\n\n8.\nPlace reaction tubes into a temperature cycler that is paused at 42\u00b0C (warm start).\n\n\n9.\nSelect the 3 stage-cycling parameters:\n42\u00b0C/60 min; 94\u00b0C/2 min, then 5 cycles of (94\u00b0C/30 s; 44\u00b0C/30 s; 68\u00b0C/3 min), followed by 23\u201331 cycles of (94\u00b0C/30 s; 57\u00b0C/30 s; 68\u00b0C/3 min) and then hold at 4\u00b0C (see Note 9).\n\n\n10.\nAnalyze 5 \u03bcl of the M-RTPCR reactions by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. An example of the results obtained from optimal (A) and typical (B) M-RTPCR amplifications are shown in Fig. 1. Differences in migration of the HA and NA segments are sometimes easily detected prior to sequencing [compare lanes 1\u20134 (H1N1) with lanes 5\u201310 (H7N2)] (Fig. 1b). The polymerase vRNAs are very similar in size (PB2 and PB1 are 2.3 kb and PA is 2.2 kb) so they migrate together.Fig. 1.M-RTPCR amplification of human and avian influenza A viruses. The viral genomes of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (a) and a series of hemagglutination-positive specimens isolated swabs collected from live bird markets in New York (b) were amplified by M-RTPCR with the Uni/Inf primer set, and 5 \u03bcl from each of the reactions was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (negative image of the ethidium bromide-stained gels are shown). The vRNA segment corresponding to the amplicon is listed to the left of panel A. The amplicons in panel B lanes 1\u201310 were subsequently sequenced and the subtype of viruses corresponding to lanes 1\u20134 was determined to be H1N1 and lanes 5\u201310 were determined to be H7N2 (note the slight shift in the migration pattern of the HA and NA vRNA amplicons). L, 1 kb \u2009+ \u2009DNA ladder (Invitrogen); P, positive control for M-RTPCR (A/USSR/77, H1N1); N1, RNA purification negative control; and N2, M-RTPCR ddH2O template control.Full size image\n\n\n11.\nStore amplicons at \u221220\u00b0C.\nThis procedure typically yields 50\u201380 ng/\u03bcl of DNA and this is related to the amount and quality of the template RNA.\n\n\n3.3 Purification of Amplicons for Nucleotide Sequencing or CloningThe M-RTPCR (and standard RTPCR) amplicons can be used directly in various applications such as enzymatic digestion, subtyping with specific primers, and can be directly cloned (particularly if you are using TOPO TA described below). However, to obtain optimal sequencing quality and cloning efficiency, the amplicons should be purified using commercially available PCR cleanup columns such as the QIAGEN QIAquick PCR purification kit used in this protocol (see Note 10). Due to the high specificity of the M-RTPCR amplification, purification from the agarose gel is generally not necessary and will result in significant loss of the amplicons.3.3.1 DNA Amplicon Purification ProcedureBefore starting, read through the QIAGEN MinElute Handbook (03/2008) and be sure that all buffers are at the appropriate working concentrations.\n\n\n1.\nAdd 24 ml of 100% molecular biology grade ethanol into the buffer PE (concentrate) bottle to obtain 30 ml working solution of buffer PE.\n\n\n2.\nAdd 5 volumes (100 \u03bcl) of buffer PB to 1 volume (20 \u03bcl) of the M-RTPCR products and mix. Add 1 \u03bcl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5) and mix.\n\n\n3.\nPlace a QIAquick spin column in a 2-ml collection tube (provided).\n\n\n4.\nApply the sample to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g.\n\n\n5.\nDiscard flow-through and place the column back into the same 2-ml tube.\n\n\n6.\nAdd 0.75 ml buffer PE into the column, let it stand for 2 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g.\n\n\n7.\nDiscard flow-through and place the column back in the same tube. Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min at 16,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g.\n\n\n8.\nMake sure that no liquid is on the side or bottom of the column and place it in a clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n\n\n9.\nAdd 30 \u03bcl buffer EB to the center of the column and ensure that it completely covers the membrane, let the column stand for 1 min and centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g (see Note 11).\n\n\n10.\nMeasure the concentration of the purified DNA with spectrophotometer and/or run 2 \u03bcl on an agarose gel with known standards to estimate/confirm the DNA concentration.\n\n\n11.\nUse for subsequent procedures or store at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\n\n3.4 Sanger Sequencing of M-RTPCR AmpliconsSanger-based nucleotide sequencing reactions are routinely carried out by institutional cores or commercial services. Therefore, this section focuses only on the factors important for initial reaction setup and the sequencing reaction method is not discussed in detail. For our Sanger approach, outlined below, the DNA is sequenced on an Applied Biosystems (ABI, by Life technologies, Carlsbad, California) 3730xl or ABI 3130xl sequencer using BigDye v3.1 Terminator Kits, and the results are analyzed with ABI Sequence Analysis 5.2 using the KB basecaller (see Note 12). For the typical automated DNA sequencing approaches used to be successful, two factors are crucial (1) the template should be of high purity and (2) the template must be accurately quantified. Failure to meet either of these criteria may result in poor or no useful sequence data.The M-RTPCR amplicons can be sequenced directly after purification in Subheading 3.4, using virus-specific primers. Ideally, a combination of spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis of the purified amplicons will give the best estimation of the amount of the DNA to use for each sequencing reaction. However, we found that the following conditions work reasonably well, given the primers match the template.3.4.1 Sanger-Sequencing Procedure (See\nNote\n13)\n\n\n1.\nAmplify the genome using M-RTPCR (recommend 50 \u03bcl reactions) or any region of the genome using strain-specific primers and purify them as described above (Subheading 3.4).\n\n\n2.\nTo sequence the PB2, PB1, and PA segments, mix 5 \u03bcl (\u223c200 ng) of purified M-RTPCR amplicons with 3.3 pmol of virus sequence-specific primer for one sequencing reaction.\n\n\n3.\nTo sequence the HA, NP, NA, M, and NS, mix 2 \u03bcl (\u223c80\u2013100 ng) of purified M-RTPCR amplicons with 3.3 pmol of sequence-specific primers for one sequencing reaction.\n\n\n4.\nIf you are sequencing small regions of amplified DNA, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the length of the product by 0.1 to determine the number of nanogram to mix with 3.3 pmol of primer.\n\n\n3.4.2 Sequencing Amplicons from Uncharacterized Influenza A Virus Positive SpecimensM-RTPCR will amplify any influenza A virus and it can be used on specimens for which sequence information is not available. Two approaches can be easily used to initially determine the probable virus lineage and subtype so that strain-specific primers can be identified for subsequent sequencing.\n\n\n1.\nSequence the M-RTPCR products using a conserved M-segment primer (M-217, 5\u2032-TCACGCTCACCGTGCCCAG-3\u2032) and analyze the results using Blast (10).\n\n\n2.\nGel purify each segment using commercially available kits and use one of the M-RTPCR primers (e.g., MBTuni-12) per sequencing reaction to partially sequence each gene (for small gene segments such as NS and M, the use of both amplification primers in two separate reactions will provide complete coverage of the gene).\n\n\n3.5 Recombination-Based Cloning of M-RTPCR Amplicons into Reverse-Genetics PlasmidsThe strict requirement for precise initiation and termination of influenza vRNA-like transcripts that is required for reverse genetics dramatically limits the restriction endonucleases available for cloning DNA copies of influenza vRNAs into reverse-genetics plasmids. Thus, cloning techniques independent of restriction sequence and ligation significantly simplify and accelerate this process. Therefore, we developed modified reverse-genetics plasmids that can be used to directly incorporate M-RTPCR amplicons (or more traditional vRNA amplicons) based on recombination between identical sequences in the termini of the M-RTPCR amplicons and the linearized reverse-genetics plasmids (7).3.5.1 Rational and Design of Recombination-Based Bidirectional Reverse-Genetics Plasmids pBZA15 and pBZ61A18 for Use in Eight-Plasmid-Based Rescue of Influenza A Viruses (See\nNote\n14)We modified a bidirectional reverse-genetics plasmid pDZ (9) by inserting a linker of 22 bp, to introduce an In-Fusion\u2122 cloning site between the existing RNA polymerase I promoter and terminator, creating pBZ61A15 (Fig. 2). Some influenza A virus vRNAs have a cytosine substitution at position 4 of the 3\u2032 terminus; therefore, pBZ61A18, which has a guanosine substituted for the adenosine in the fourth position of the complement of the 3\u2032-terminal promoter element of influenza A virus was also created. These reverse-genetics plasmids were designed for cloning dsDNA copies of any influenza A virus vRNA segment using recombination between short regions (15\u201319 nucleotides) of identity between the plasmid and influenza A virus amplicons using commercially available enzymes. Ligase-independent recombination-based cloning can be accomplished using \u201chome-brew\u201d approaches (11); however, the In-Fusion kit (Clontech) is recommended because of its efficiency and reproducible results. Amplicons of each of the eight vRNA segments that are present after M-RTPCR can be cloned simultaneously into the PstI-linearized pBZ61A15 or pBZ61A18 plasmids in a single reaction by using In-Fusion cloning (see\nNote\n15). Alternatively, any amplicon of an influenza A vRNA segment, which is appropriately tailed at the 5\u2032 terminus (6\u20139 nt), can be cloned into these pBZ plasmids (or any properly designed plasmid) using the procedures outlined below.Fig. 2.Recombination-based cloning of M-RTPCR amplicons into reverse-genetics plasmids. Schematic diagram of the procedure used to clone M-RTPCR amplicons into our recombination-based reverse-genetics plasmid pBZ61A15. The M-RTPCR amplicons (1 segment shown) contain a dsDNA copy of a vRNA segment flanked by ten (5\u2032) or six (3\u2032) bp that are derived from the 5\u2032-tails incorporated into the M-RTPCR primers (Uni13/Inf1 and Uni12/Inf1). The 13-conserved nucleotides at the 5\u2032 termini of all influenza vRNAs (Uni13) and the 12-conserved nucleotides found at the 3\u2032 termini (Uni12) are shown in bold type. To generate the reverse-genetics plasmid, a 22 bp fragment containing 9 bp that correspond to the 5\u2032 termini of all vRNAs, followed by 4 bp (shown in gray) to create the Pst1 site, followed by 9 bp that correspond to the 3\u2032 termini of all vRNAs, was inserted between an RNA polymerase I promoter (pPol I) and terminator (Pol I-T). The RNA polymerase II promoter and poly A signal, which flank the Pol I promoter and terminator in an opposing orientation, in this plasmid are not shown. The plasmid is digested with Pst1 and purified. The M-RTPCR amplicons and Pst1 linearized plasmid are mixed and treated with In-Fusion enzyme, and exonuclease activity exposes the complementary nucleotides at the termini leading to annealing and recombination (underlined nucleotides are the primer sequences used in M-RTPCR). The clones generated produce mRNAs from the RNA polymerase II promoter and authentic vRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase I upon transfection into appropriate host cells.Full size image\n3.5.2 Preparation of Linearized Reverse-Genetics Plasmids\n\n\n1.\nPrepare pBZ61A15 and pBZ61A18 plasmids with any commercial kits (e.g., QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit) or standard alkaline lysis methods.\n\n\n2.\nDigest 5 \u03bcg of each plasmid with 200 U (10 \u03bcl) of restriction endonuclease PstI, in a 300 \u03bcl reaction volume, at 37\u00b0C for 6 h.\n\n\n3.\nAnalyze 10 \u03bcl of the digestion by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure complete digestion.\n\n\n4.\nPurify the digested products using the QIAquick PCR purification kit following the procedure described in Subheading 3.3, but elute with 50 \u03bcl buffer EB instead of 30 \u03bcl.\n\n\n5.\nMeasure DNA concentration using spectrophotometer and dilute DNA to 50 ng/\u03bcl, aliquot multiple vials each containing 20 \u03bcl diluted DNA.\n\n\n6.\nStore vials at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\n\nTypically \u223c4 \u03bcg of linearized plasmid DNA will be recovered from 5 \u03bcg of starting material.3.5.3 Cloning of Amplicons into pBZ61A15 and pBZ61A18 or Other Similarly Modified Reverse-Genetics Plasmids (See\nNote\n16)\n\n\n1.\nAmplify the influenza A virus genome by M-RTPCR using the Uni/Inf primer set, as described in Subheading 3.2, using 28\u201330 temperature cycles total (see Note 17) and purify as described in Subheading 3.3.\n\n\n2.\nMix 200 ng of purified M-RTPCR amplicons with 100 ng of linearized pBZ61A15 and pBZ61A18 in two separate 200 \u03bcl PCR reaction tubes. Bring the volume to 7 \u03bcl each with ddH2O (see Note 18).\n\n\n3.\nAdd 2 \u03bcl of 5\u00d7 In-Fusion reaction buffer and 1 \u03bcl of In-Fusion enzyme into each tube and pipette to mix completely but gently.\n\n\n4.\nUse a temperature cycler to incubate the mixture at 37\u00b0C for 15 min and 50\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 4\u00b0C hold.\n\n\n5.\nDilute the mixture with 40 \u03bcl TE buffer (pH 8), pipette to mix, and leave on ice.\n\n\n6.\nThaw competent cells on wet ice, add 3 \u03bcl of each diluted mixture into a corresponding vial of cells. Tap the vials gently to mix. Keep the vials on wet ice.\n\n\n7.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min. Tap the vials every 10 min.\n\n\n8.\nIncubate vials at 42\u00b0C (water bath preferred) for exactly 30 s, followed by immediate incubation on wet ice for 2 min.\n\n\n9.\nAdd 450 \u03bcl of room temperature S.O.C. into each vial.\n\n\n10.\nIncubate the transformation mixture for 1 h at 37\u00b0C (shaking at 250 rpm is desirable).\n\n\n11.\nSpread 20 and 200 \u03bcl of each transformation onto two labeled LB Agar plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin (or appropriate antibiotic).\n\n\n12.\nIncubate the plates inverted at 37\u00b0C for 16\u201320 h. Typically there are thousands of colonies on the 200 \u03bcl plate and hundreds of colonies on the 20 \u03bcl plate.\n\n\n13.\nScreen for clones using standard PCR amplification across the insert region, or enzymatic digestion to identify the colonies containing the correct clones. If the nucleotide sequence is not determined for the 4th position of the 3\u2032 terminus of vRNA, then PB2, PB1, and PA clones should be selected from the pBZ61A18 vector, whereas HA, NP, NA, M, and NS should be selected from the pBZ61A15 vector.\n\n\n3.6 TOPO TA Cloning Influenza Virus AmpliconsAlthough the In-Fusion and other ligase-independent cloning systems are amenable to any plasmid vector (including other reverse-genetics plasmids), there are a number of situations in which it is desirable to clone fragments into commercially available plasmids developed for specific functions (e.g., sequencing, RNA transcription, or protein expression). The TOPO TA Cloning Systems available (Invitrogen) are fast, efficient, and reliable for cloning any RT-PCR products, including M-RTPCR amplicons, into a wide range of plasmids (see Note 19). This system takes advantage of the fact that Taq DNA polymerases (including the high-fidelity version we recommend for M-RTPCR) add single non-templated nucleotides to the 3\u2032 termini of amplicons [often these are 3\u2032 adenosine (A) overhangs]. The vectors are provided as linearized plasmids with 3\u2032 deoxythymidine (T) overhangs that is bound to topoisomerase I, which efficiently ligates the inserts and plasmid. The 3\u2032 A overhangs of the PCR product complement the 3\u2032 T overhangs of the vector and allow for fast ligation (5 min).3.6.1 TOPO TA Cloning Procedure\n\n\n1.\nAmplify the influenza A virus genome by M-RTPCR using either primer set as described in Subheading 3.2, using 28\u201330 temperature cycles total. Alternatively, amplify a specific segment using virus-specific terminal primers or segment-specific universal primers described by Hoffmann et al. (5) (see Note 20).\n\n\n2.\nConcentration and purification of amplicons (optional, see Note 21).\n\n\n(a)\nPrepare buffers for Zymo Research, Inc. DNA Clean and Concentrator\u2122-5 as directed by manufacturer.\n\n\n(b)\nAdd 40\u201350 \u03bcl of M-RTPCR, or other RTPCR reaction, to 1.5-ml tube.\n\n\n(c)\nAdd 250 \u03bcl of the DNA Binding Buffer and mix briefly by vortexing.\n\n\n(d)\nTransfer mixture to the Zymo-Spin\u2122 Column in a collection tube.\n\n\n(e)\nCentrifuge at 12,000\u201316,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.\n\n\n(f)\nAdd 200 \u03bcl Wash Buffer to the column, and centrifuge at 12,000\u201316,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g for 30 s.\n\n\n(g)\nRepeat wash step.\n\n\n(h)\nAdd 10 \u03bcl of ddH2O directly to the column matrix.\n\n\n(i)\nTransfer the column to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 12,000\u201316,000 \u2009\u00d7 \u2009g for 30 s to elute the DNA.\n\n\n\n\n3.\nAdd 4 \u03bcl of amplicons from step 1, or purified amplicons from step 2, to a 0.2-ml PCR tube or a 1.5-ml tube.\n\n\n4.\nAdd 1 \u03bcl of salt solution (provided in kit).\n\n\n5.\nAdd 1 \u03bcl of the TOPO plasmid, mix by pipetting, and incubate 5 min at 22\u201325\u00b0C, then place on ice or store at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\n\n6.\nTransform chemically competent Top10 E. coli (supplied) with 2\u20134 \u03bcl of the TOPO reaction as described in Subheading 3.5.3, steps 6\u201313.\n\n\n4 Notes\n\n\n1.\nTwo (MBTuni-12 and MBTuni-12.4, or Uni12/Inf-1 and Uni12/Inf-3) of the three primers used in each set are nearly identical except for a single nucleotide (italicized). The A or G is used because the 3\u2032 termini of the vRNA segments vary at the 4th position (U or C), and this is dependent on the segment and the virus lineage. Often the polymerase segments have a C at this position and most other segments have a U, however this has not been extensively studied. It is recommended that the two primers be synthesized independently rather than synthesizing a primer with an R at this position (e.g., 5\u2032-ACGCGTGATCAGCRAAAGCAGG-3\u2032), so that the ratio of the two primers can be controlled.\n\n\n2.\nUniversal influenza A virus primers with 5\u2032-tails that contain Mlu1 and Bcl1 restriction enzyme sites (Mlu1 is very rare in influenza A virus). The MBTuni primer set generally yields more robust amplification of all segments, but the ratio of small segment to large segments is greater than the Uni/Inf set. This primer pair is recommended for sequencing of the amplicons and can also be used for cloning of full-length segments into standard plasmids via ligation, TOPO TA, or ligase-independent cloning approaches.\n\n\n3.\nThe Uni/Inf primer set was designed primarily for cloning influenza A virus gene segments into reverse-genetics plasmids using ligase-independent cloning procedures, but can also be used for other downstream cloning and sequencing approaches. This primer set typically yields more uniform amplification of each gene segment.\n\n\n4.\nIf starting with cloacal swabs, we recommend isolation of virus by inoculation of eggs or TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction with 10 \u03bcg of carrier tRNA.\n\n\n5.\nKeep RNA template on ice (4\u00b0C) at all times.\n\n\n6.\nUnequal concentrations of the Uni12/Inf1 and Uni12/Inf3 are used to improve amplification of the larger vRNAs (PB1, PB2, and PA). If using the MBTuni primer set, the same volumes should be used for MBTuni-12 and MBTuni-12.4.\n\n\n7.\nThe master mix was calculated for one additional reaction to account for small losses during pipetting.\n\n\n8.\nThe use of negative controls for both the RNA isolation process and the M-RTPCR reaction itself can help to identify the source of contamination if it occurs.\n\n\n9.\nThere are a number of variables that need to be considered and incorporated into the cycling parameters. The warm start reduces nonspecific amplification products. The regions of the oligos that hybridize with the influenza vRNAs are very short and A:T rich; therefore, 3\u20138 cycles with a lower annealing temperature (43\u201345\u00b0C) are required to incorporate the tailed primers into cDNA and for initiation of second strand synthesis. Finally the total number of cycles used varies depending upon the ultimate use of the amplicons. If the amplicons will be used for sequencing, 36 cycles (5 with an annealing temperature at 44\u00b0C and 31 with an anneal temperature of 57\u00b0C) are typically used. If the amplicons will be used for cloning purposes, 28 cycles (5 with an annealing temp at 44\u00b0C and 23 with an anneal temperature of 57\u00b0C) are typically used. Finally, the type of cloning procedure to be used should also be considered, if the products will be incorporated into TA-based cloning plasmids it is advisable to add a 10 min hold at 68\u00b0C between the 3rd stage and the hold at 4\u00b0C, because this will increase the percentage of the amplicons that have incorporated non-templated 3\u2032 adenosines.\n\n\n10.\nWe also find that the columns from Zymo Research, Inc. described later (Subheading 3.6.1) are very good for purification, particularly if you need to concentrate the amplicons.\n\n\n11.\nThe elution is very sensitive to pH. If using water to elute, make sure that the pH \u2009> \u20097. DEPC-treated water sometimes can have a quite acidic pH. Therefore, we recommend following QIAGEN\u2019s guidelines and use Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0 for elution of the DNA. We avoid TE because the EDTA can have inhibitory effects in some enzymatic reactions.\n\n\n12.\nSome minor adjustments based upon the equipment and reagents used may be required, so you should discuss the sequencing of PCR products with your sequencing service provider.\n\n\n13.\nAlthough M-RTPCR amplicons are well-suited for a high-throughput genomic sequencing using Sanger, or massively parallel technologies such as 454 sequencing, this section describes approaches for use by typical academic-type laboratories. Also, to sequence a complete genome one would need to setup \u223c10 M-RTPCR reactions. Another approach for complete genome sequencing is to use M-RTPCR for a first-round amplification and then use the amplicons as templates for overlapping PCR reactions with multiple primer sets. Primers for this type of approach were developed as part of the NIAID influenza genome sequencing project and can be found on the J. Craig Venter Institute website (http://gsc.jcvi.org/projects/msc/influenza/infl_a_virus/primers.shtml).\n\n\n14.\nA modified 12-plasmid reverse-genetics plasmid (pG26A12) derived from pHH21 was also produced and is described by Zhou et al. (7). We also refer to Chapter 12 for more details about the various reverse-genetics approaches.\n\n\n15.\nThe In-fusion enzyme has 3\u2032-exo nuclease activity, so the 3\u2032-overhang left from PstI digestion will be removed in the reaction and will not interfere with the recombination of the identical sequences between the amplicons and plasmids (Fig. 2). In a previous version, we used StuI (7) as the linearization enzyme; however, PstI is a more efficient enzyme than StuI.\n\n\n16.\nAmplicons from segment-specific RTPCR reactions that have the same 5\u2032-tails as the Uni/Inf primers can also be cloned into these pBZ plasmids. Additionally, virtually any plasmid (including most reverse-genetics plasmids) can be modified by the insertion of the In-Fusion cloning sites similar to those we have designed.\n\n\n17.\nTo reduce/limit mutations created during PCR, we use fewer temperature cycles for cloning procedures. Three\u2013five cycles with an annealing temperature of 44\u00b0C are required to tail the DNA copies but the second stage can be reduced and this will reduce total yield but improve fidelity.\n\n\n18.\nIt is advisable to include the following controls in the In-Fusion reaction and transformation: (1) linearized vector only for In-Fusion reaction followed by transformation, (2) amplicon only for In-Fusion reaction followed by transformation, (3) pUC19 (included in the competent cell kit) control for transformation efficiency, and (4) mock-transformed bacteria as a control.\n\n\n19.\nWe recommend these systems primarily because they are straightforward and provide reproducible results.\n\n\n20.\nThe MBTuni primer set is recommended for this type of cloning because these primers contain restriction enzyme recognition sequences that are convenient for colony screening and subcloning into other plasmids.\n\n\n21.\nAlthough concentration and purification of amplicons is not required for cloning RTPCR amplicons into TOPO TA plasmids, we find that this can increase the number of positive colonies and thereby reduce screening efforts."}
{"text": "Cloning and Expression of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Full-Length Nonstructural  Gene in Pichia pastoris \n Abstract \n Avian influenza (AI) is a highly contagious and rapidly evolving pathogen of major concern to the poultry industry and human health. Rapid and accurate detection of avian influenza virus is a necessary tool for control of outbreaks and surveillance. The AI virus A/Chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 (H5N1) was used as a template to produce DNA clones of the full-length NS1 genes via reverse transcriptase synthesis of cDNA by PCR amplification of the NS1 region. Products were cloned into pCR2.0 TOPO TA plasmid and subsequently subcloned into pPICZ\u03b1A vector to construct a recombinant plasmid. Recombinant plasmid designated as pPICZ\u03b1A-NS1 gene was confirmed by PCR colony screening, restriction enzyme digestion, and nucleotide sequence analysis. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115 strain by electroporation, and expressed protein was identified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. A recombinant protein of approximately ~28\u2009kDa was produced. The expressed protein was able to bind a rabbit polyclonal antibody of nonstructural protein (NS1) avian influenza virus H5N1. The result of the western blotting and solid-phase ELISA assay using H5N1 antibody indicated that the recombinant protein produced retained its antigenicity. This further indicates that Pichia pastoris could be an efficient expression system for a avian influenza virus nonstructural (NS1).1. IntroductionAvian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease of major concern to both the poultry industry and human health; the currently ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 since 1997 have been unprecedented with over 500 million birds destroyed and over 303 humans dead. This development has ignited a global fear of imminent Influenza pandemic. Even though, adoption of vaccination policy as a targeted control or prevention measures has been generally discouraged by the scientific community. However, the need to boost eradication efforts in order to limit the spread of infections and ensure safety against international trade embargoes and avoid economic losses couple with the recent advances in DNA technology has prompted a re-evaluation of both vaccine strategies and restrategising of diagnostic tool as an additional effort in the battling against highly pathogenic avian influenza control programme [1\u20133].Recent advances in molecular DNA biotechnology of protein expression and production of recombinant viral protein using various expression systems are becoming popular, more acceptable, and efficient. The ease with which genes are manipulated to yield recombinant protein both for vaccines and diagnostics is fast revolutionalizing the industry.Yeast has been endowed with the capacity for easy posttranslational modification of expressed polypeptides with ease. Their intracellular environment is more suitable for correct folding of eukaryotic virus protein [4]. The use of methylotrophic yeast system for foreign protein expression is  increasing dramatically, since the advent of the first world licensed genetically engineered vaccine antigen for hepatitis B for human in 1986 was prepared using yeast recombinant [5]. In this study, we described the expression of AIV NS1 in Pichia pastoris as an easy tool for generating efficient expression system that could have potential for serological diagnostics of AIV without compromising surveillance.2. Materials and Methods Inactivated influenza A/chicken/5858/Malaysian 2004 (H5N1) was kindly provided by  Veterinary Research Institute, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia. Trizol RNA extraction method was employed in the extraction of the viral RNA, under BLS-3 condition. Plasmid DNA extraction and gel purification were employed in accordance with kits manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The following primers were employed for RT-PCR: the sense primer P 1 and antisense   primer F 5\u2032CTC GGC TCG AGT ATG GAT TCC AAC ACT GTG 3\u2032 and F 5\u2032GAC TGC GGC CGC GCT CTT ATC TCT TGC TCC 3\u2032. RT-PCR was performed under the following conditions:  the reaction mixture contained in a final concentration of 1x of reaction buffer, 5\u2009mM of MgCl2, 0.8\u2009\u03bcM of each primer (NS1 F & NS1 R), 0.1\u2009mM of dNTP, 2\u2009U of AMV reverse transcriptase, and 5\u2009U of recombinant RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor and 100\u2009ng of extracted RNA template. The mixture was initially incubated as follows: briefly, at 45\u00b0C for 50\u2009min, reverse transcriptase denature at 94\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, chilled at 4\u00b0C,  the   full denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2\u2009min,  at 94\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, 1\u2009mins at 53\u00b0C, 2\u2009min at 68\u00b0C for 40 circles of amplification, and 10\u2009min at 68\u00b0C for an additional extension. The PCR products of the full length of AIV A/Chicken/5858/Malaysian/H5N1 strain NS1 generated was purified using GENEALL GEL SV Kit (General Biosystem, Korea) and subsequently cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO vector from TOPO TA Cloning  Kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The amplified products of the gene encoding NS1 and pPICZ\u03b1A expression vector were digested and subcloned according to standard procedures [6].The recombinant pPICZ\u03b1A-NS1 gene was sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Korea), and nucleotide sequences were analyzed using Bio Edit software program. The sequence used for comparison or analysis in this study was A/chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 (H5N1) (DQ321197.1) obtained from the GenBank database. The comparison was done using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The nucleotides of the NS1 gene were compared with the published sequences from around the world. A 100% homology was obtained with A/chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 (H5N1) on NCBI blast (as shown below).3. Results and Discussion The full length of Influenza A/Chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004/(H5N1) NS1 gene of 801\u2009bp in size was amplified by RT-PCR, sequenced, and cloned into pCR2.0 TOPO TA cloning vector (Figure 1). Purified DNA clone of amplified full-length NS1 gene was inserted into the expression vector pPICZ\u03b1A to generate a recombinant plasmid pPICZ\u03b1A-NS1 (Figure 2). After comparing the nucleotide sequence of NS1 gene derived from the recombinant plasmid pPICZ\u03b1A-NS1, its deduced amino acid sequence was found to be NS1 of H5N1 strain with 100% homology, and the nucleotide sequence was found to be similar to that influenza A/Chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 (H5N1) strain with 100% homology, as shown in (Figure 4). Figure 1\u00a0Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of two-step RT-PCR amplified  NS1 gene of AIV using NS1F and NS1R primers.Figure 2\u00a0Restriction enzyme analysis of pPICZ\u03b1A NS1 recombinant plasmid with XhoI and NotI in the   Forward and backward primers, respectively; lanes 2 and 3: vector-3.2\u2009kb and insert gene 801\u2009bp, lane1: 1\u2009kb DNA ladder marker (Fermentas, USA).Immunoblotting results revealed the antigenic band of ~28\u2009kDa NS1 of HPAI using polyclonal antibody against the 28\u2009kDa NS1 protein. These findings strongly suggested that this protein might be useful as potential antigen for diagnostics against natural/experimental HPAI infections. This result also indicated successful expression of NS1 gene of avian influenza subtype H5N1 designated as GS115/pPICZA/NS1, an approximately ~28\u2009kDa protein confirmed via western blot using NS1 polyclonal antibody (Figure 3) and indirect ELISA using purified recombinant NS1 protein as coating antigen (Table 1).Table 1\u00a0OD650 values of preliminary ELISA for detection of positive NS1 recombinant protein.(a) (b) (a) (b) Figure 3\u00a0\n                        (a) Western blot analysis showing the expressed NS1 recombinant protein of ~28\u2009kDa in expressed  GS115 Pichia pastoris strain using NS1 polyclonal antibody as a primary antibody; expression started at day 7 after methanol induction; (b) SDS-PAGE separating the proteins into different molecular weight prior to transfer to NC membrane and immunodetection.Figure 4\u00a0While avian Influenza (AI) continues to remind us of one of the most fearful diseases threatening the poultry industry and human population, it has an economic burden and international trade impacts with serious embargoes; it causes loss of production and productivity both on individual and the society [7, 8]. NS1 of the influenza virus is a highly conserved gene when compared with other encoded proteins, though it has poor antigenicity. Previous study showed that within the influenza virion there was no NS1 protein, but it could be highly expressed by cells infected with influenza virus [9]. Therefore, birds vaccinated with inactivated vaccines did not produce nonstructural protein-specific antibodies, so NS1 antibodies are only presented in naturally infected birds; therefore, this could provide a \u201cwindow\u201d opportunity for the differentiation between the vaccinated and the naturally infected birds, a major challenge to serological surveillance. In this study, we amplified and cloned the NS1 gene of an AI strain A/Chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 (H5N1), into the pPICZ\u03b1A eukaryotic expression system. The recombinant plasmid designated as GS115-pPICZ\u03b1A-NS1 was analyzed by RE digestion, PCR colony screening, and sequencing analysis. Immunodetection using NS1 polyclonal in antibody in western blot (Figure 3) further confirmed the antigenicity and correct folding of the recombinant protein. Restriction enzyme digestion has been a method of choice when screening a lot of transformants. However, high zeocin concentration were used for screening of high copy no of positive Pichia transformants [6]. In conclusion, the NS1 gene of H5N1 subtype influenza A virus was successfully cloned and expressed via shake flask following methanol inductions. These results laid foundation as a preliminaries finding for developing an effective diagnostics marker for influenza A (H5N1) using recombinant DNA technology.  The inability to differentiate antibody due to either natural infection or vaccination has been a serious setback hindering the progress of surveillance programme by interfering with accuracy of diagnosis, and by extension this can affect the free market flow of poultry and poultry product at the international market, resulting in a trade embargoes enforcement. In the present study, it has been demonstrated that the ability to clone and express NS1 recombinant protein in a shake flask fermentation condition will offer an armful opportunity for the production of this NS1 recombinant protein that was shown to specifically bind NS1 polyclonal antibodies on Western blot; it has also shown a potentially promising result in an indirect ELISA (Table 1) using putative recombinant as coating antigen. It could  differentiate between infected and vaccinated birds, in that NS1 antibodies could only be detected in natural/experimental infections. Based on the above results, it has been clearly demonstrated that the difference between the positive and negative purified cell lysate samples is more than threefold difference; therefore, it is envisage that this may have a good potential for diagnosis in the case of clinical or experimental infections or natural outbreaks, even though this might require further assay using field samples.  Previous studies had  shown that a difference equal to or greater than threefold is enough to demonstrate the establishment of an infection, while the indirect ELISA is ongoing trials and validation have been projected that this could be useful at quarantine stations, where only a single convalescent serum sample is obtained. This technology would offer a simple and less expensive diagnostic antigen with less hazardous contact with a whole viral particle commonly encountered in the conventional method."}
{"text": "A seven plasmid-based system for the rescue of influenza C virus. \n Abstract \n Following the first detection of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in sick geese in Guangdong Province in China in 1996, scientists began to develop vaccines in preparation for an avian influenza pandemic. An inactivated H5N2 vaccine was produced from a low pathogenic virus, A/turkey/England/N-28/73, and was used for buffer zone vaccination during H5N1 outbreaks in 2004 in China. We also generated a low pathogenic H5N1 reassortant virus (Re-1) that derives its HA and NA genes from the GS/GD/96 virus and six internal genes from the high-growth A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus using plasmid-based reverse genetics. The inactivated vaccine derived from the Re-1 strain could induce more than ten months of protective immunity in chickens after one-dose inoculation; most importantly, this vaccine is immunogenic for geese and ducks. We recently developed a Newcastle virus-vectored live vaccine that exhibits great promise for use in the field to prevent highly pathogenic avian influenza and Newcastle disease in chickens. Over 30 billion doses of these vaccines have been used in China and other countries, including Vietnam, Mongolia, and Egypt, and have played an important role in H5N1 avian influenza control in these countries.KeywordsAvian InfluenzaNewcastle Disease VirusH5N1 VirusAvian Influenza VirusH5N1 Avian InfluenzaThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Among the 15.2 billion poultry, over 60% are bred in small-scale farms or in backyards. China is home to an even larger population of waterfowl\u2014approximately 70% of the world\u2019s total. The majority of these waterfowl are ducks that are distributed in the provinces of southern China, and these ducks are raised in the open field, which is rich in lakes and rivers. During breeding season, the ducks may migrate from one province to another, over hundreds of miles. This special breeding style brings domestic waterfowl into contact with both wild waterfowl and other domestic animals, such as chickens and pigs, allowing the waterfowl to play an important role as intermediate hosts in the transfer of influenza viruses from wild birds to domestic animals. Waterfowl migration also serves to spread influenza from one place to another, which poses huge difficulties in the control of avian influenza in China.The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus was first detected in a goose in the Guangdong Province of China in 1996. Multiple genotypes of H5N1 viruses have been identified from apparently healthy waterfowl since 1999 (Chen et al. 2004). In the years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, there were 50, 31, 10, and 4 outbreaks, respectively, in domestic poultry and wild birds in China (Chen et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2005; Wan et al. 2005). These outbreaks occurred in 23 provinces and caused severe economic damage to the poultry industry in China. Since 2004, over 35,000,000 poultry have been depopulated in order to control the disease. Meanwhile, vaccines have also been used in the poultry in the buffer areas of disease outbreak sites.The development of vaccines for H5 avian influenza has been supported by the government since the detection of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus GS/GD/96 in 1996. During the last ten years, we have successfully developed several inactivated vaccines using naturally isolated low pathogenic H5N2 virus or artificially generated, low-pathogenic, high-growth reassortant virus in reverse genetics as seed viruses (Tian et al. 2005). Two kinds of live virus-vectored vaccines using the fowlpox virus and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as backbones were also developed in China (Ge et al. 2007; Qiao et al. 2003). Here, we will present the development and application of vaccines to control H5N1 avian influenza in China, and we will also summarize the development of our two new vaccines.2 Inactivated Vaccines2.1 Inactivated H5N2 VaccineAn inactivated oil-emulsified vaccine has been developed using an low pathogenic H5N2 virus, A/Turkey/England/N-28/73 (kindly provided by Dr. Danis Alexander), as a seed virus. The vaccine was approved for use in August of 2003 in Guangdong Province in chickens that were exported to Hong Kong and Macau. This vaccine was fully evaluated by the Chinese Veterinary Drug Evaluation Committee and was certified by the end of 2003. After the H5N1 outbreak in 2004, this vaccine was licensed to nine companies that have Good Manufacture Practice (GMP) facilities and the experience to produce egg-cultured vaccines. In total, 2.5 billion doses of inactivated H5N2 vaccine were used in the districts containing H5N1 outbreaks in 2004 (Table 1).Table 1 Vaccines developed and used for H5N1 avian influenza control in China from 2004\u20132007Full size table\n2.2 Inactivated H5N1 VaccineThe use of the H5N2 vaccines, along with other measures, facilitated rapid control over H5N1 outbreaks in China in 2004. However, this vaccine is not an ideal one. First, the vaccine seed virus exhibited antigenic diversity from the H5N1 strains prevalent in China at the time. Second, the seed virus could not grow to high titers in eggs, which severely impaired vaccine production. To solve these problems, we used plasmid-based reverse genetics (Fodor et al. 1999; Hoffmann et al. 2000; Neumann et al. 1999) to generate several reassortant viruses that contained the internal genes from the high-growth A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus and the HA and NA genes from the H5N1 viruses GS/GD/1/96, A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/3/2005 and A/duck/Anhui/1/2006 (Table 1). The multiple basic amino acids (\u2013RRRKKR\u2013) in the cleavage site of the HA protein that are associated with virulence in H5 avian influenza viruses were changed into \u2013RETR\u2013 (Li et al. 1999; Subbarao et al. 2003), a characteristic of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (Perdue et al. 1997; Senne et al. 1996). The reassortant virus, Re-1, that bears the HA and NA genes from GS/GD/1/96 was investigated extensively. The virus is completely attenuated in chicken embryos and chickens (Tian et al. 2005). It does not kill eggs within 72 h after inoculation and achieves a titer of more than 11 (log2). Most importantly, the Re-1 virus contains the HA and NA genes of the GS/GD/1/96 virus, which antigenically matches well with the H5N1 viruses that circulated in China (Chen et al. 2004). This inactivated H5N1 vaccine induced higher HI antibody responses and longer lasting protective immunity in chickens than the H5N2 vaccines, and was shown to be effective in ducks and geese (Tian et al. 2005). The vaccine was approved for use in the field by the end of 2004, and over 20 billion doses of the Re-1 vaccine have been used in China (18.04 billion doses) (Table 1), Vietnam, Mongolia, and Egypt so far.In early 2006, an H5N1 avian influenza virus was isolated from a chicken flock that had been vaccinated with the inactivated H5 vaccines. The disease in those flocks was recorded as a decrease in egg production and a mortality range of 10\u201320%. The virus, denoted CK/SX/06, exhibited huge antigenic drift from the viruses that were isolated in China previously. Though 187,000 poultry were depopulated to control the spread of this new virus after its first detection in February, the virus was reisolated in June from the Shanxi and Ningxia provinces. We found that the inactivated H5 vaccines used in China provided only 80% protection against the variant strain in a laboratory challenge study in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, which was quite different from the protective efficacy we had reported previously (Tian et al. 2005). We therefore developed a new reassortant virus, designated Re-4, which contained the cleavage site-modified HA and NA genes from CK/SX/06 and six internal genes from the PR8 virus. This new vaccine was approved for use in Shanxi, Ningxia, and several of their neighboring provinces in northern China in August. A total of 1.26 billion doses were used in 2006 and 2007 (Table 1).In some areas, cocirculation of both the GS/GD/96-like virus and CK/SX/06-like viruses was detected; therefore, an H5N1 vaccine that was produced from the combined antigens of Re-1 and Re-4 was also approved for use in a limited area in northern China. A total of 2.2 billion doses of this vaccine were used in 2007 (Table 1).2.3 Inactivated H5N1 Marker VaccineThe current commercially used inactivated H5N1 vaccine is safe and effective, providing complete protection from highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses (Tian et al. 2005). However, the current inactivated H5N1 vaccine does not allow for serological distinction between vaccination and field infection. Recently, intensive vaccination with marker vaccines and stamping-out strategies have been gaining popularity in veterinary medicine for eradicating specific diseases of national or international interest. A marker vaccine is defined as one that can be used in conjunction with a diagnostic test to differentiate a vaccinated animal from a naturally infected animal (Babiuk 1999). A genetically marked H5N1 influenza vaccine that could readily be distinguished from wild-type strains would therefore be of great value in the eradication plan, allowing for vaccination programs that would not interfere with the serological surveillance of influenza viruses circulating in the wild.We recently generated an attenuated H5N1 influenza marker vaccine seed virus, denoted H5N1/PR8-5B19, which derives its internal genes from the PR8 virus and modified H5 HA and N1 NA genes from the GS/GD/1/96 virus (Li et al. 2008). H5N1/PR8-5B19 encodes an attenuated HA molecule to allow for low pathogenicity in poultry and an NA molecule bearing the foreign 5B19 epitope of the S2 glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV). H5N1/PR8-5B19 grew to high titers in embryonated eggs and in chickens without leading to sickness. When chickens were inoculated with one dose of the inactivated vaccine generated from the H5N1/PR8-5B19 virus, 70% of the chickens were positive for anti-5B19 antibody postvaccination. The chickens that received a booster dose at the end of two weeks after the first immunization were 100% positive for anti-5B19 antibody. In contrast, sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with the inactivated H5N1/PR8 vaccine or infected with the H5N1/PR8 virus showed no reactivity against the 5B19 epitope in a peptide-ELISA diagnostic test. In the vaccine trial, at 21 days after inoculation with one dose of the vaccine, chickens were challenged intranasally with different H5N1 viruses. No signs of disease associated with H5N1 infection were observed in any of the chickens immunized with inactivated H5N1/PR8-5B19 vaccine. No virus was recovered from the tracheal and cloacal swabs on day 3 after the challenge with homologous or heterologous H5N1 viruses. In contrast, the challenge virus was detected in the tracheal and cloacal swabs from all of the control chickens, and killed all of the control chickens in the observation period. These data show that the H5N1/PR8-5B19 marker vaccine elicited strong antibody responses to influenza HA and to the MHV 5B19 epitope, and provided complete immunity to H5N1 HPAIV challenge.H5N1/PR8-5B19 is the first H5N1 vaccine candidate with the desired properties of efficient replication in eggs, safe use in birds, and the ability to serologically discriminate between infected and vaccinated chickens. Although additional experiments are necessary, the results we got show that the recombinant H5N1/RP8-5B19 virus should be considered a potential candidate for an H5N1 influenza marker vaccine for chickens that may eventually be used in the field to control the spread of H5N1 influenza virus infection in poultry.3 Live Virus-Vectored Vaccine3.1 Recombinant Fowlpox VaccineWhole-virus inactivated vaccines and fowlpox virus-based recombinant vaccines have been used as control strategies for highly pathogenic avian influenza in the laboratory and in poultry farms located in different geographic regions in the world (Capua et al. 2003; Ellis et al. 2004; Swayne et al. 2000; van der Goot et al. 2005). In addition to the inactivated vaccines, we also developed two kinds of recombinant vaccines using fowlpox virus and NDV as vectors (Ge et al. 2007). After the detection of the GS/GD/96 virus, we began developing a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing the HA and NA genes of H5N1 virus as a live virus-vectored vaccine. The vaccine efficacy of this recombinant virus was proven in both laboratory and field tests (Qiao et al. 2003). About 0.615 billion doses of the recombinant fowlpox vaccine have been used in poultry in China since 2005.3.2 Recombinant Newcastle Disease Virus VaccineThe NDV live virus-vectored vaccine against influenza has several advantages, including ease of production, high production yield, ease of widespread administration to animals in the field, and its ability to serve as a bivalent vaccine against two viruses that can decimate bird populations. The use of NDV as the vaccine backbone should prevent confusion between vaccinated birds and infected birds for surveillance purposes, which is a problematic issue with the use of whole-virus influenza vaccines. Highly pathogenic Newcastle disease has been endemic, and more than thirty billion doses of live vaccines are used in chickens every year in China.In 2005, we established a reverse genetics system for NDVs (LaSota) and generated several recombinant NDVs expressing the avian influenza virus HA genes from several H5N1 viruses representing different phylogenetic lineages of the viruses isolated in China (our unpublished data). These viruses included GS/GD/96, A/duck/Anhui/1/06, and A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/3/05. Recently, we also generated a recombinant NDV expressing the HA gene of the CK/SX/06 virus. We have demonstrated that the recombinant NDVs expressing the various HA genes induce strong HI antibody responses to NDV and to H5 avian influenza viruses in chickens. The recombinant NDV-vaccinated chickens were protected from disease signs and death from challenge with highly pathogenic NDV. Most importantly, the vaccinated chickens were completely protected from homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus challenges and displayed no virus shedding, signs of disease, or death (Ge et al. 2007).At the beginning of 2006, a recombinant NDV virus that expressed the HA gene of GS/GD/96 was approved for use in chickens as a bivalent, live attenuated vaccine for controlling the H5N1 avian influenza and highly pathogenic Newcastle disease. By the end of 2007, a total of four billion doses of this vaccine had been applied in chickens (Table 1), which dramatically increased the vaccination coverage.4 DNA VaccineAlthough inactivated whole-virus vaccine (Tian et al. 2005), recombinant fowlpox vaccines (Qiao et al. 2003), and the recombinant NDV vaccine (Ge et al. 2007) have been used in China and some other countries, DNA vaccines may offer a number of advantages over these vaccine strategies for avian influenza virus control and infection prevention. First, DNA immunization can achieve both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, similar to an attenuated live virus vaccine, and it has the safety of a killed or subunit vaccine (Donnelly et al. 2000; Garmory et al. 2003; Liu et al. 1998; Webster 1999). Second, DNA vaccines are easier to manufacture and store than inactivated whole-virus vaccines. Third, immune responses are generated against the expressed gene product and not the DNA vaccine vector. Although previous studies (Chen et al. 2001; Fynan et al. 1993; Sharma et al. 2000; Suarez and Schultz-Cherry 2000) have confirmed the efficacy of the HA gene-based DNA vaccine against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus challenge in chickens, the high dosage (200\u2013400 \u03bcg plasmid DNA) needed is a major obstacle to the field application of such vaccines. We therefore explored a strategy to decrease the dosage of DNA vaccine required by improving the expression of the target gene.We constructed an H5 HA gene, optiHA, containing chicken-biased codons based on the HA amino acid sequence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus GS/GD/96. The optiHA was inserted to the plasmid pCAGGS under the control of chicken \u03b2-actin, and designated pCAGGoptiHA. We evaluated the vaccine efficacy of pCAGGoptiHA by intramuscular injection with different dosages (100, 10, or 1 \u03bcg) of the plasmid. All of the vaccinated chickens developed detectable HI and NT antibodies, with the titers of the antibodies correlating with the dosage of plasmid inoculated. When the chickens were challenged with a lethal dose of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, all of the 100- and 10-\u03bcg plasmid inoculated chickens were completely protected from disease signs and death, while 1-\u03bcg plasmid inoculated chickens were only partially protected. The vaccine efficacy of the low-dosage plasmid inoculation (1 \u03bcg) could be improved by a second immunization (Jiang et al. 2007). Further investigation demonstrated that two doses of 10 \u03bcg of the pCAGGoptiHA inoculation could induce protection lasting more than a year (Jiang et al. 2007), which covers the entire time period of the layers kept at the farm, thus eliminating the need for costly serial vaccinations. The clinical field trial of this DNA vaccine is currently ongoing.5 ConclusionIn this chapter, we have briefly summarized the development and application of vaccines for the control of highly pathogenic avian influenza in China. The epidemic of H5N1 avian influenza in China resulted in the deaths of over 35,000,000 poultry through either infection or depopulation during 2004\u20132007, and led to severe economic damage to the poultry industry. China employs the culling plus vaccination strategy to control H5N1 avian influenza, and financial support from the government ensures the implementation of this strategy. Billions of doses of the vaccines have been used in the field, and the vaccines are antigenically well matched to the circulating strains. Though the government has required 100% vaccine coverage in domestic poultry since the end of 2005, it is impossible to give every single bird one or two doses of the vaccine in practice, as over 70% of the birds are reared in small-scale or backyard farms, often in the open field with ducks and geese. It is clear that the increased vaccination coverage results in decreased disease epidemics. There is no doubt that vaccination has played an important role in protecting poultry from H5N1 virus infection, reducing the virus load in the environment, and preventing the transmission of the H5N1 virus from poultry to humans. However, it is worth noting that the complete control and eradication of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses can ultimately only be achieved through a combination of vaccination, improved biosecurity, extensive surveillance and an effective monitoring program."}
{"text": "A seven-segmented influenza A virus expressing the influenza C virus glycoprotein HEF. \n Abstract \n Influenza viruses are classified into three types: A, B, and C. The genomes of A- and B-type influenza viruses consist of eight RNA segments, whereas influenza C viruses only have seven RNAs. Both A and B influenza viruses contain two major surface glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). Influenza C viruses have only one major surface glycoprotein, HEF (hemagglutinin-esterase fusion). By using reverse genetics, we generated two seven-segmented chimeric influenza viruses. Each possesses six RNA segments from influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS); the seventh RNA segment encodes either the influenza virus C/Johannesburg/1/66 HEF full-length protein or a chimeric protein HEF-Ecto, which consists of the HEF ectodomain and the HA transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. To facilitate packaging of the heterologous segment, both the HEF and HEF-Ecto coding regions are flanked by HA packaging sequences. When introduced as an eighth segment with the NA packaging sequences, both viruses are able to stably express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, indicating a potential use for these viruses as vaccine vectors to carry foreign antigens. Finally, we show that incorporation of a GFP RNA segment enhances the growth of seven-segmented viruses, indicating that efficient influenza A viral RNA packaging requires the presence of eight RNA segments. These results support a selective mechanism of viral RNA recruitment to the budding site.Influenza viruses, which belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, are classified into three types: A, B, and C (31). The genomes of A- and B-type influenza viruses consist of eight single-stranded, negative-sense RNA segments, whereas influenza C viruses have only seven RNAs (31). Both A and B influenza viruses contain two major surface glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin (HA), possessing the receptor-binding and fusion activities; and the neuraminidase (NA), which destroys the receptor by cleaving sialic acid from host cell membranes, thereby releasing newly formed virus particles (31). Influenza C viruses contain only one major surface glycoprotein, HEF (hemagglutinin-esterase fusion), which has the receptor-binding fusion as well as receptor-destroying/esterase activities (13, 31). HEF forms a homotrimer and binds to 9-O-acetylneuraminic acid on the cell surface, while the HAs of influenza A and B viruses, which also form a homotrimer, instead recognize N-acetylneuraminic acid as their receptors (31). The fusion activity of both HEF and HA requires proteolytic cleavage of the full-length precursor into two disulfide bond-linked subunits: HEF0 into HEF1 and HEF2 and HA0 into HA1 and HA2. After cleavage, the fusion peptide on the HEF2 or HA2 subunit is able to mediate membrane fusion upon the low pH activation in the endosome (12, 31).A late step of influenza virus replication in cells involves the packaging of each individual viral RNA (vRNA) segment into budding virions, in an equimolar manner. The mechanism of vRNA packaging is not fully understood. Two models have been proposed for influenza A virus: the random incorporation model and the selective packaging model (31). The random incorporation model argues that all vRNA segments possess a common packaging feature and are incorporated indiscriminately, with the result that full genomes are assembled only by chance (1, 6). The selective packaging model argues that each RNA segment has a specific feature\u2014the unique packaging sequence\u2014which allows the selective incorporation of eight segments into a budding virion. Recently, evidence supporting the specific packaging model has accumulated. Several groups have found that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding sequences as well as sequences at both ends of the coding region are important for vRNA packaging (9, 10, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 29, 30, 43). Utilizing these packaging sequences, foreign transgenes can be carried by the influenza virus either transiently, only for several passages, or stably, for multiple passages (20, 21, 36, 43).Reverse genetics, the generation of negative-sense RNA virus from cloned cDNA, has revolutionized research on influenza virus (8, 27). Methods to rescue all three types of influenza viruses, A, B, and C, have been successfully established (5, 8, 14, 15, 24, 27). Reverse genetics has been utilized to study the influenza viral replication cycle, to characterize the function of influenza viral proteins, and to understand the high pathogenicity of the 1918 and H5N1 viruses (4, 11, 16, 39, 44). Reverse genetics can also be used to design live attenuated vaccines, such as influenza A and B viruses expressing altered type I interferon antagonist (NS1) proteins, live in ovo vaccine against avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses, and H5N1 influenza A virus carrying an M2 protein with deletions in the cytoplasmic tail (37, 38, 42). Because the replication cycle of influenza virus lacks a DNA phase, the viral genome cannot integrate into the host genome. This property makes the influenza virus a promising, safe candidate for a vaccine or gene delivery vector (28). With reverse genetics, foreign RNAs that are flanked by influenza virus packaging sequences can be incorporated into influenza virions, allowing the expression of foreign proteins in infected host cells (21, 36, 43).In this study, we substituted the two major glycoproteins of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/PR/8/34) virus, HA and NA, with the single major glycoprotein of influenza virus C/Johannesburg/1/66 (C/JHB/1/66) virus, HEF, and successfully generated two seven-segmented chimeric influenza viruses. The two viruses each possess six influenza A virus RNA segments (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS) and one chimeric RNA segment encoding either the influenza C virus HEF full-length protein or the chimeric protein HEF-Ecto, which consists of HEF ectodomain and HA transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Both HEF and HEF-Ecto RNA segments carry sequences from A/WSN/33 HA RNA at the two ends to allow packaging into virions. Furthermore, both viruses are able to stably incorporate one extra green fluorescent protein (GFP) RNA segment carrying the NA packaging sequences, demonstrating a new approach to developing a vaccine or gene delivery vector.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and viruses.293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Both cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The viruses were grown in 8- or 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicken embryos (Charles River Laboratories, SPAFAS, Preston, CT).Plasmid construction. (i) Generation of pPOL I-HEF construct.The open reading frame (ORF) of the HEF protein, which is 1,965 bp long, was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from influenza virus C/JHB/1/66 vRNA (Fig. 1A). Two restriction sites, NheI and XhoI, were introduced to flank the HEF ORF. The pPOL I-HA (A/WSN/33) plasmid carrying two restriction sites, NheI (nucleotides 78 to 83) and XhoI (nucleotides 1,645 to 1,650), was generated previously (21), and the original HA translation start codon ATG (nucleotides 33 to 35) was mutated to CTG. The HEF ORF PCR fragment was digested with NheI and XhoI and ligated to the NheI and XhoI sites of pPOL I-HA with 45 and 80 nucleotides of packaging sequences from the HA ORF. The two restriction sites used for ligation, NheI and XhoI, were removed by site-directed mutagenesis after ligation, generating the final pPOL I-HEF construct (Fig. 1A).(ii) Generation of pPOL I-HEF-Ecto construct.By using a similar strategy, the pPOL I-HA (A/WSN/33) plasmid carrying restriction sites NheI (nucleotides 78 to 83) and XhoI (nucleotides 1,605 to 1,610) was generated, and the original HA translation start codon was also mutated to CTG (Fig. 1A). The ORF encoding the HEF ectodomain, which is 1,893 bp long and flanked by NheI and XhoI restriction sites at the two ends, was amplified by RT-PCR from C/JHB/1/66 vRNA and ligated to the NheI and XhoI sites of a pPOL I-HA plasmid backbone with 45 and 117 nucleotides of packaging signals from the HA ORF. The NheI and XhoI sites were also removed by site-directed mutagenesis after ligation, generating the final pPOL I-HEF-Ecto construct.(iii) Generation of pDZ-GFP-1 and pDZ-GFP-2 constructs.The previously constructed pDZ-NA (A/PR/8/34) (21, 33) was digested with SphI and BmtI, treated with a DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, and then self-ligated using T4 DNA ligase in order to remove the NheI and XhoI sites on the vector backbone, generating the plasmid pDZ-NA (\u2212NheI, \u2212XhoI) (Fig. 2A). The 2.2-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment from the pDZ-NA plasmid, which contains the A/PR/8/34 NA gene, was subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC18 vector and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to generate NheI (nucleotides 132 to 137) and XhoI (nucleotides 1,223 to 1,228) sites on the NA ORF. The two ATG codons before the NheI site were mutated to TTG. Finally, the 2.2-kb EcoRI-Hind III fragment was subcloned back into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the pDZ-NA (\u2212NheI, \u2212XhoI) plasmid, replacing the original 2.2-kb fragment. The resulting plasmid was digested with NheI and XhoI and ligated with the GFP fragment digested with the same enzymes, generating the construct pDZ-GFP-1, in which the GFP ORF is flanked by 111 nucleotides and 157 nucleotides of packaging sequences from the NA ORF. The GFP ORF was derived from the previously constructed pPOL I HA(45)GFP(80) plasmid (21). The plasmid pDZ-GFP-2, with 153 and 181 nucleotides of NA ORF packaging sequences at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of GFP, was constructed by using similar methods. The three ATG codons before the NheI site were also mutated to TTG by site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of primers used for cloning and site-directed mutagenesis are available from the authors upon request.Reverse genetics for recombinant viruses.The method for generating recombinant influenza viruses was modified from previously described protocols (8, 33). Briefly, for the generation of HEF- or HEF-Ecto-containing viruses, 293T cells were transfected with six A/PR/8/34 plasmids (pDZ-PB2, pDZ-PB1, pDZ-PA, pDZ-NP, pDZ-M, and pDZ-NS), one pPOL I-HEF or pPOL I-HEF-Ecto plasmid, three A/WSN/33 protein expression plasmids (pCAGGS-HA, pCAGGS-NA, and pCAGGS-NS1), plus or minus the GFP plasmid (pDZ-GFP-1 or pDZ-GFP-2). For the generation of recombinant A/PR/8/34 (rA/PR/8/34) virus expressing the A/WSN/33 HA and NA, six A/PR/8/34 plasmids (pDZ-PB2, pDZ-PB1, pDZ-PA, pDZ-NP, pDZ-M, and pDZ-NS) and two A/WSN/33 plasmids (pPOL I-HA and pPOL I-NA) were used to transfect 293T cells. The plasmids (0.5 \u03bcg each) were added in one well of a six-well plate. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, the supernatants and cells were harvested and inoculated into 8- or 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs, and the eggs were incubated at 33\u00b0C for three days. The allantoic fluids were harvested and subjected to hemagglutination assay to determine the presence of viruses.Western blotting.Viruses were grown in 8- or 10-day-old chicken embryos at 33\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for two to three days. The allantoic fluids were harvested, and the viruses were purified by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. Purified viruses were resuspended in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 2\u00d7 protein loading buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromophenol blue). The protein lysates were separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Inc.). The membrane was then probed with mouse monoclonal antibody against A/PR/8/34 NP protein (HT103, 1 \u03bcg/ml), A/WSN/33 HA protein (2G9, 1 \u03bcg/ml), or C/JHB/1/66 HEF protein (8D6D3, 1 \u03bcg/ml).Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified vRNA.The viruses were grown in 8- to 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at either 33\u00b0C for HEF- or HEF-Ecto-containing viruses or 37\u00b0C for rA/PR/8/34 virus expressing the WSN HA and NA. Two to three days later, the embryos were killed by transferring them to 4\u00b0C and were left overnight. The allantoic fluids were harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 15 min using a Beckman rotor SW28. Clarified supernatant was then layered on a 30% sucrose cushion and further centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 2.5 h. Pelleted virus was resuspended in 1\u00d7 PBS buffer, and vRNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Precipitated vRNA was resuspended in a final volume of 15 \u03bcl DNase- and RNase-free H2O and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA (0.5 to 1 \u03bcg) was separated on a 2.8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The gel was stained with a SilverXpress silver staining kit (Invitrogen) to visualize the RNA bands.Immunostaining of plaques.The protocol was modified from a previously reported method (23). Briefly, a MDCK cell monolayer in six-well plates was infected with viruses in serial 10-fold dilutions for 1 h and covered with agar overlay containing 1 \u03bcg/ml l-1-tosylamide-2-phenyl-ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Sigma). Two to three days later, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde containing 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 h. The agar overlay was removed and blocked with 1\u00d7 PBS containing 5% dried nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the cells were incubated overnight with the first antibody: rabbit anti-A/PR/8/34 polyclonal antibody for rA/PR/8/34 virus expressing the A/WSN/33 HA and NA (1:2,000 dilution); or mouse anti-HEF monoclonal antibody (8D6D3, 1 \u03bcg/ml) for HEF- and HEF-Ecto-containing viruses and influenza C/JHB/1/66 virus. The cell monolayer was washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Amersham ECL-HRP linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). The cells were washed three times with PBS and stained with TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL).Viral growth kinetics.Eight-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with influenza viruses (100 PFU/egg) and incubated at 33\u00b0C. At 24, 48, and 72 h postinoculation, the eggs were transferred to 4\u00b0C and left overnight, after which the allantoic fluids were harvested. The titer of the viruses was determined by plaque assay or immunostaining of the plaques in MDCK cells.RESULTSGeneration of recombinant seven-segmented influenza viruses.In this study, we attempted to generate an influenza A virus containing the influenza virus C/JHB/1/66 glycoprotein HEF instead of HA and NA. The 1,965-bp full-length HEF ORF was amplified by RT-PCR from the C/JHB/1/66 vRNA. In order for the HEF segment to be packaged into influenza A virions, the ORF was flanked by the previously identified packaging sequences of A/WSN/33 HA (the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 noncoding regions [NCRs] plus the 45 nucleotides proximal to the start codon and the 80 nucleotides proximal to the stop codon of the HA ORF [21, 43]). The resultant cDNA was then inserted into the pPOL I plasmid to generate the pPOL I-HEF construct (Fig. 1A). The original HA translation start codon ATG was mutated to CTG, such that the HEF protein is translated from its own initiation codon (Fig. 1A).Although the overall structures are similar, HA and HEF only share about 12% sequence identity (35). Compared to HA, C/JHB/1/66 HEF has a shorter transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, which are 20 and 3 amino acids long, respectively (26, 32). In addition, for HEF, the cysteine residue next to the cytoplasmic domain is acylated with stearic acid, while for HA, the cysteine residues of C-termini undergo palmitoylation (40, 41). Considering these differences and the possibility that the C-terminal portion of the HA protein may be required for the assembly of virions (3, 45, 46), we also generated an HEF-Ecto chimeric gene, in which the 1,893-bp ORF encoding the HEF ectodomain was fused to the sequences encoding the HA transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1A). The HEF-Ecto chimeric gene is also flanked by HA NCRs and 45 nucleotides of packaging sequence from the HA ORF that are proximal to the start codon. Expression of both HEF and HEF-Ecto RNAs is driven by a human RNA polymerase I promoter and terminated with the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence.By using previously established methods (see Materials and Methods), two chimeric HEF- and HEF-Ecto-containing viruses (hereafter called the HEF and HEF-Ecto viruses) were successfully rescued (Fig. 1B) and were found to be stable for at least five passages in embryonated chicken eggs. HEF virus contains six RNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from A/PR/8/34 and one HEF segment flanked by the influenza A virus packaging sequences. HEF-Ecto virus contains the same six backbone segments from A/PR/8/34 and one HEF-Ecto chimeric segment (Fig. 1B). In order to characterize the protein compositions, the viruses were grown in the allantoic cavities of embryonated chicken eggs and purified by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. Western blotting was performed to detect the presence of individual proteins using specific monoclonal antibodies. The results showed that both HEF and HEF-Ecto viral particles contain the A/PR/8/34 NP and the C/JHB/1/66 glycoprotein HEF1, which is the proteolytic cleavage product of full-length precursor HEF0. Both viruses were also shown not to contain influenza A virus HA (Fig. 1C), since HA1, the cleavage product of full-length HA0, is only detected in rA/PR/8/34 virus expressing the A/WSN/33 HA and NA. In order to show that the newly obtained HEF or HEF-Ecto chimeric virus indeed contains seven RNA segments, RNA was purified and run on an acrylamide gel to visualize the genome compositions by silver staining (Fig. 1D). The results showed that both HEF and HEF-Ecto viruses contain seven RNA segments: PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, NS, and one chimeric segment, HEF or HEF-Ecto. The chicken 18S rRNA derived from ribosomes, which were copurified with virions, was also visible on the gel. Both viruses lack the influenza A virus RNA segments HA and NA, which are present in rA/PR/8/34 virus expressing the A/WSN/33 HA and NA (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that the abundance of A/WSN/33 NA vRNA in the A/PR/8/34 background is low possibly because of inefficient packaging (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the intensity of the HEF segment RNA from the HEF virus is about 50% less than that of the corresponding PA segment, while the HEF-Ecto RNA segment of the HEF-Ecto virus is comparable to that of PA (Fig. 1D). This indicates that the packaging efficiency of the HEF-Ecto RNA segment is higher than that of HEF RNA, which may be due to the presence of longer HA packaging sequences at the 5\u2032 end (Fig. 1A).When traditional plaque assay methods are used, the influenza C/JHB/1/66 virus does not lyse cells and forms clear plaques in MDCK cells (34). In this study, we found that the newly rescued HEF and HEF-Ecto chimeric viruses grew very poorly in MDCK cells and were also unable to form visible plaques by regular plaque assay methods. Thus, in order to titrate the C/JHB/1/66, HEF, and HEF-Ecto viruses, we performed immunostaining of plaque assays, using a method modified from a previous report (23). Briefly, the viruses were subjected to regular plaque assay using MDCK cells. After fixation with formaldehyde, instead of staining the cell monolayer with crystal violet, we used specific monoclonal antibody against HEF protein and peroxidase substrate to visualize the \u201cplaques\u201d (Fig. 1E). At 33\u00b0C, C/JHB/1/66 forms bigger \u201cplaques\u201d than both the HEF and HEF-Ecto viruses, and the \u201cplaques\u201d formed by HEF-Ecto are the smallest (Fig. 1E).Generation of HEF or HEF-Ecto viruses carrying a GFP RNA segment.The selective packaging model argues that eight segments are required for efficient packaging of influenza A virus genomes (9, 10, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 29, 30, 43). If this model is correct, the HEF or HEF-Ecto chimeric viruses could be modified to carry one additional RNA segment that contains the NA packaging sequences. To determine whether this is the case, we generated GFP constructs in which the GFP ORF is flanked by the A/PR/8/34 NA 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 packaging sequences: pDZ-GFP-1 and pDZ-GFP-2 (Fig. 2A). GFP-1 carries 111 and 157 nucleotides of the NA coding region flanking the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, respectively, and GFP-2 carries slightly longer sequences from the NA ORF, 153 and 181 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, respectively. Because the packaging sequences of the A/PR/8/34 NA segment have not been characterized, we tested shorter NA terminal sequences in pDZ-GFP-1 and longer sequences in pDZ-GFP-2. All ATG codons before the GFP translation initiation codon in both constructs were mutated to TTG; thus, the translation of GFP utilized its own start codon. Unpublished data from our lab showed that mutating these ATGs did not interfere with vRNA packaging. GFP-1 and GFP-2 chimeric genes are expressed from the ambisense pDZ plasmids, which were described previously (33). By using reverse genetics techniques, we successfully rescued the GFP-carrying HEF and HEF-Ecto viruses (HEF+GFP and HEF-Ecto+GFP), each of which contains the six A/PR/8/34 backbone segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS), one chimeric segment HEF or HEF-Ecto, and one extra segment GFP-1 or GFP-2 (Fig. 2B). Western blot results showed that both HEF+GFP and HEF-Ecto+GFP virions contain A/PR/8/34 NP and C/JHB/1/66 glycoprotein HEF1 but not HA (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, to show that both viruses do contain the GFP segment, the RNA was isolated from purified viruses and run on an acrylamide gel to visualize the viral genome compositions by silver staining (Fig. 2D and E). GFP-1 and GFP-2 RNA segments can be seen in both HEF+GFP (Fig. 2D) and HEF-Ecto+GFP (Fig. 2E) virions, and with similar incorporation efficiencies. Consistent with this result, GFP protein was expressed in 293T cells infected with viruses HEF+GFP or HEF-Ecto+GFP, with either GFP-1 or GFP-2, but not in cells infected with seven-segmented HEF or HEF-Ecto virus (Fig. 2F and G).Incorporation of an extra GFP segment increases the growth rate of the seven-segmented viruses.We compared the growth kinetics of HEF and HEF-Ecto viruses with or without a GFP segment, as well as those of the rA/PR/8/34 virus expressing the A/WSN/33 HA and NA and the C/JHB/1/66 virus, in 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 33\u00b0C (Fig. 3). For each virus at every time point, the allantoic fluids from three eggs were analyzed. The results showed that incorporation of a GFP-1 or GFP-2 RNA segment significantly increased the growth rate of HEF and HEF-Ecto viruses (Fig. 3B and C). At 24 h postinoculation, the titers of both HEF+GFP (HEF+GFP-1 and HEF+GFP-2) and HEF-Ecto+GFP (HEF-Ecto+GFP-1 and HEF-Ecto+GFP-2) viruses were about 10 times higher than those of the seven-segmented viruses (Fig. 3B and C). At 48 and 72 h postinoculation, there were no significant differences in the titers (Fig. 3B and C). These results indicate that the presence of eight RNA segments enhances viral replication, possibly through more-efficient vRNA packaging. Although HEF-Ecto virus forms much smaller \u201cplaques\u201d than HEF virus in MDCK cells (Fig. 1E), no significant differences were observed for the growth rates of HEF and HEF-Ecto viruses in embryonated chicken eggs (Fig. 3B and C). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains to be determined.Stability of HEF or HEF-Ecto viruses carrying a GFP segment.The rescued HEF+GFP-1, HEF+GFP-2, HEF-Ecto+GFP-1, and HEF-Ecto+GFP-2 viruses were passaged in 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs to determine whether their genomes are stable over multiple passages. As shown in Fig. 4A, similar levels of GFP-2 RNA were observed for HEF+GFP-2 virus at passage 1 and passage 7. Although the GFP-1 vRNA of HEF+GFP-1 virus is not separable from M vRNA in the gel (Fig. 4A), we were still able to assess its similar levels of presence at passage 1 and passage 7 by observing the GFP expression in infected cells (data not shown). The same phenomenon was also observed for HEF-Ecto+GFP-1 and HEF-Ecto+GFP-2 viruses (Fig. 4B). At passage 1 and passage 7, overall titers of the viruses were similar, and comparable levels of expression of GFP in 293T or MDCK cells were also observed. In addition, no mutations were observed for either HEF or HEF-Ecto vRNA segments after seven passages.DISCUSSIONRNA viruses with segmented genomes can undergo reassortment when two viruses coinfect the same cell, allowing them to exchange genetic information and generate new strains which may be more adapted to the environment (31). Although influenza A, B, and C viruses have a common ancestor, reassortment between different types has never been observed (31). This could be due to the incompatibility of either viral proteins or vRNAs. Previously, Flandorfer et al. generated influenza A viruses carrying the full length of either the NA or HA ectodomain from influenza B virus, demonstrating a certain degree of compatibility between influenza A and B virus RNAs and proteins (7). During the past several years, the packaging signals have been identified in each RNA segment of influenza A virus. These packaging signals not only include 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NCRs but also the termini of each ORF, which vary in length for each segment (9, 10, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 29, 43). By using the packaging sequences, foreign RNA segments can be incorporated into virions of influenza A virus (21, 36). In this study, using the HA packaging sequences, we generated two influenza A viruses that express the influenza C virus glycoprotein HEF instead of HA and NA. Indeed, both viruses contain seven RNA segments (Fig. 1D).The successful rescue and the high titers of these viruses show that the influenza C virus HEF glycoprotein is fully compatible with the other influenza A viral components. This is surprising given the low (12%) amino acid sequence identity shared between HEF and HA (32, 35). In addition, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of HEF are shorter than those of HA, and the cysteine residues undergo different modifications (26, 32, 40, 41). Despite these differences, HEF can fully replace the two glycoproteins, HA and NA, in the seven-segmented viruses generated in this study, indicating that the relatively long cytoplasmic region and palmitoylation of HA are not specifically required for influenza A virus. This conclusion is further supported by the data derived from HEF-Ecto chimeric viruses, in which the HEF ectodomain is fused to the HA transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Although the HEF-Ecto RNA segment has a higher packaging efficiency than that of the HEF RNA segment (Fig. 1D), the growth rate of HEF-Ecto viruses is similar to that of HEF viruses (Fig. 3B and C). It is also possible that the HEF ectodomain and HA transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions used in this study may not be fully compatible with each other. Exactly how many amino acids each domain contains and especially what the optimal junction site is still need to be demonstrated.Influenza virus is a promising candidate for vaccine vector development because its replication does not have a DNA phase and it is highly immunogenic. Previous work by Luytjes et al. first described that a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene segment can be maintained for several passages by influenza virus (20). Other strategies, including inserting foreign peptides into the HA antigenic sites or the NA stalk region, have also been shown to be successful (2, 17). In the past several years, the sequences that are required for packaging of vRNA into virions have been identified by several groups. The characterization of these packaging sequences supports a specific packaging theory, which argues that for efficient vRNA packaging of influenza A virus, eight RNA segments are required (9, 10, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 29, 30, 43). How these packaging sequences function during the virion assembly process is still unclear. Foreign genes that are flanked by these sequences can be packaged into virions, which can then serve as vaccine or gene delivery vectors. In this study, the generation of HEF or HEF-Ecto viruses carrying an extra GFP segment further supports the potential of influenza viruses to act as gene vectors (Fig. 2). Despite the fact that the HEF or HEF-Ecto viruses carrying seven RNA segments can be rescued and are stable over multiple passages, the addition of an extra segment flanked by the NA packaging sequences enhances the viral growth in embryonated chicken eggs (Fig. 3). The fact that eight-segmented virus has a higher growth rate than the seven-segmented virus indicates that the HEF or HEF-Ecto virus is a suitable candidate to develop a vaccine or gene delivery vector. Previous work by Watanabe et al. also showed that influenza virus can carry an extra GFP-encoding segment after substituting the HA and NA segments with a segment expressing the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (43). The use of influenza C virus HEF protein in this study provides another example of how influenza virus can be exploited as a vaccine vector.In conclusion, in this study we generated two seven-segmented influenza A viruses expressing the C glycoprotein HEF instead of HA and NA. Both of the viruses are able to stably carry an additional RNA segment expressing a foreign gene, indicating that the seven-segmented viruses can be used as vaccine or gene delivery vectors carrying transgenes. This study also supports the specific packaging theory of influenza vRNA incorporation into virions.FIG. 1.FIG. 1. Generation of recombinant seven-segmented influenza viruses HEF and HEF-Ecto. (A) Construction of pPOL I-HEF and pPOL I-HEF-Ecto plasmids. The HEF ORF or HEF ectodomain is flanked by A/WSN/33 HA 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NCRs and packaging sequences from the HA ORF at the two ends. Both chimeric genes are driven by a human RNA polymerase I promoter to produce vRNAs. \u201cTm\u201d and \u201cCyto\u201d designate the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic region of HA, respectively. The light gray portion in each construct designates the ORF of C/JHB/1/66 HEF. The translation start and stop codons of each construct are indicated by arrows.

Six A/PR/8/34 ambisense plasmids (pDZ-PB2, pDZ-PB1, pDZ-PA, pDZ-NP, pDZ-M, and pDZ-NS) and one pPOL I plasmid (pPOL I-HEF or pPOL I-HEF-Ecto) were used to generate the recombinant HEF or HEF-Ecto virus by using reverse genetics (8, 33). (C) Incorporation of HEF full-length or HEF-Ecto chimeric glycoprotein into the recombinant seven-segmented virions. The rA/PR/8/34 virus expressing the A/WSN/33 HA and NA (rA/PR/8/34+WSN HA, NA), which was grown at 37\u00b0C, and three viruses (C/JHB/1/66, HEF, and HEF-Ecto) which were grown at 33\u00b0C were inoculated into 8- or 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Two to three days later, allantoic fluids were harvested and virions were purified by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. A Western blot was performed to detect the presence of HEF, NP, and HA proteins using specific monoclonal antibodies. (D) The genome of HEF or HEF-Ecto virus contains seven RNA segments.

Two to three days postinfection, the agar overlay was removed after formaldehyde fixation. The cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against A/PR/8/34 for the rA/PR/8/34 virus expressing the A/WSN/33 HA and NA or with mouse monoclonal antibody against HEF for the C/JHB/1/66, HEF, and HEF-Ecto viruses. The second day, the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for 1 h at room temperature, and the \u201cplaques\u201d were visualized by using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate.FIG. 2.FIG. 2.

The GFP ORF is flanked by the A/PR/8/34 NA 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NCRs and packaging sequences from the NA ORF. For the pDZ-GFP-1 construct, GFP is flanked by 111 and 157 nucleotides of the NA ORF; and for the pDZ-GFP-2 construct, 153 and 181 nucleotides of packaging sequences are used. Both GFP constructs are in the ambisense pDZ vector backbone which was described previously (33). The dark gray designates the GFP ORF.

{"text": "Reverse genetics of the avian influenza virus. \n Summary \n Reverse genetics is the creation of a virus from a full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome, referred to as an infectious clone, and is the most powerful genetic tool in modern virology.

Introduction Recombinant DNA technology enables us to analyze and manipulate genomes at the molecular level. However, for nonretroviral RNA viruses, the genome does not enter a DNA phase during replication, and direct manipulation of RNA substrates is challenging. For this reason, the study of the molecular biology of RNA viruses has lagged despite the small size of their genome [1]. Genetic manipulation of negative-strand RNA viruses, such as the influenza virus (belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae), is even more demanding because isolated genome or antigenome RNAs are not infectious by themselves, and the virus is segmented. In order to serve as a functional template to initiate transcription/replication, the viral RNA (vRNA) has to be transcribed into a plus-sense mRNA by the polymerase complex, which includes three viral polymerases (PB2, PB1, and PA) and the nucleoprotein (NP) [2]. The influenza virus has a genome comprised of eight RNA gene segments that must be expressed and packaged to complete the virus replication cycle. Furthermore, unlike many other RNA viruses, the influenza virus replicates in the nucleus of infected cells, which adds to the complexity of developing a reverse genetics system [3].The reverse genetics system for the influenza virus was established in 1999 by two different research groups [4, 5], relying on the cellular enzyme RNA polymerase I for the synthesis of influenza viral RNAs. RNA polymerase I is an abundant nuclear enzyme that transcribes ribosomal RNA [6]. RNA polymerase I initiates and terminates transcription at defined promoter and terminator sequences, and the resulting transcript does not contain additional nucleotides at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end. Thus, this enzyme is ideal for generation of influenza vRNA in the nucleus. Currently, de novo synthesis of the influenza virus is achieved by co-transfection of cells with 12 plasmids: Eight plasmids contain the RNA polymerase I promoter, a cDNA encoding one of each of the influenza viral RNAs, and the terminator; the remaining four plasmids express viral proteins required for vRNA replication and transcription (PB1, PB2, PA, NP)(see Figure 1). Although slight modifications are being introduced to improve the rescue system [7, 8], the basic concept of synthesizing vRNA using the RNA polymerase I system remains the same.Fig. 1Plasmid-based reverse genetics system. (a) Cells are transfected with eight transcription plasmids (transcribing the eight viral RNA segments) together with four protein (NP, PA, PB1, and PB2) expression plasmids or (b) eight bidirectional plasmids [7]. After 48 hours of transfection, the harvested cells and cell supernatants are inoculated into embryonating chicken eggs or MDCK cells depending on the strains being rescued. After 48 hours of incubation, allantoic fluid or cell supernatant is harvested and tested for the presence of infectious virusFull size image\n2. Materials\n2.1.

Methods\n3.1. Amplification of Full-Length Individual Genes\n\n\n\n1.\nViral RNAs are extracted using Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen), RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), or QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer (see Chapter 3). Two hundred fifty microliters (\u03bcL) of infectious amnioallantoic fluid [containing 106\u20131010 50% egg infectious doses per mL (EID50/mL) of virus] are typically used for RNA extraction. High viral titer samples are typically required for efficient cloning of the viral genes, and clinical material is usually not a reliable sample for amplification of the full-length genes. The extracted RNAs are eluted or resuspended in a final volume of 50 \u03bcL of RNase-free water (see\n\nNote 2\n).\n\n\n2.\nThe entire coding and noncoding regions of each of the eight individual genes are amplified by standard reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with the Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) (see\n\nNote 3\n) and primers listed in Section 2.1. Primers are directed to the 12 or 13 conserved bases at the ends of each influenza viral RNA segment and contain the BsmBI restriction site for cloning purposes. The RT step is performed with incubation steps of 45 \u00b0C for the PA, PB1, and PB2 genes and 50 \u00b0C for the other genes for 30 min. An additional step of 95 \u00b0C for 15 min is needed to activate the hot-start taq in the Qiagen kit and may not be necessary with other RT-PCR reagents. The PCR incubation steps are 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C denaturation for 30 s, 53 \u00b0C annealing for 15 s, and 72 \u00b0C extension for 60 s to 135 s, depending on the length of the individual genes (see\n\nNote 4\n).\n\n\n3.\nThe PCR products are separated on a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis, and amplicons of the appropriate size are subsequently excised from the gel and extracted using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\n\n3.2. Cloning\nTo generate the influenza virus entirely from cloned cDNA, at least 12 plasmids should be constructed (see\n\nNote 5\n). The RT-PCR product of the NP, PA, PB1, and PB2 genes can be cloned directly into the pCR\u00ae3.1 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol (see\n\nNote 6\n).Eight transcription plasmids are further constructed by inserting the eight individual viral genomic sequences between the human RNA polymerase I promoter and the mouse RNA polymerase I terminator sequence in the pHH21 vector following the procedure described below.\n\n1.\nPreparation of inserts:\n\na.\nDigest the RT-PCR products (0.5\u20132 \u03bcg) with BsmBI restriction enzyme by adding 2 \u03bcL in a 20 -\u03bcL reaction. Incubate the reaction mix at 55 \u00b0C for at least 2 hr.\n\n\nb.\nSeparate on a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis, and the digested products of the appropriate size are subsequently excised from the gel and purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit. Although inserts of low concentration have been successfully cloned into the vector, it is recommended to prepare digested inserts of 25\u2013100 ng/\u03bcL (see\n\nNote 7\n).\n\n\n\n\n2.\nPreparation of pHH21 vector:\n\na.\nDigest the vector (2.5\u20135.0 \u03bcg) with BsmBI enzyme (3 \u03bcL) in a 30 -\u03bcL reaction. Incubate the reaction mix at 55 \u00b0C for at least 2 hr. Separate the plasmid by electrophoresis on an agarose gel, and purify the digested vector as described above.\n\n\nb.\nDephosphorylate the restriction-digested vector (50\u2013100 ng/\u03bcL) to prevent self-ligation by treating with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) (Promega) (1 unit/\u03bcg DNA) at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Then, inactivate the SAP by heating at 65 \u00b0C for 15 min. Briefly centrifuge the reaction mix. SAP-treated vectors may be used immediately or stored at -20 \u00b0C for later use.\n\n\n\n\n3.\nCloning into the pHH21:\n\na.\nLigate the digested insert and vector using LigaFast\u2122 Rapid DNA Ligation System (Promega). In a 10 -\u03bcL ligation reaction, add 1 \u03bcL of vector (25\u2013100 ng), 3 \u03bcL of insert (75\u2013300 ng), 5 \u03bcL of 2X ligation buffer, and 1 mL of ligase. Mix the reaction gently and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n\n\nb.\nUse 2 \u03bcL of the above ligation reaction for transformation into competent cells. Follow the general transformation protocol that can be found elsewhere [9]. pHH21 vector contains the ampicillin resistance gene, and LB plates containing 100 mg/mL of ampicillin can be used for clone selection.\n\n\nc.\nThe presence and orientation of the insert can be screened using vector-specific primers in combination with a unique primer for the insert. Select and pick 6\u201312 colonies and culture them for 4 hr in 200 \u03bcL of LB medium containing 100 \u03bcL/mL of ampicillin in 96-well tissue culture plate at 37 \u00b0C. Use 1 mL of culture from each well as a template for 12.5 \u03bcL of PCR reaction to screen for positive clones using the vector-specific primers.\n\n\nd.\nOnce clones with the correct inserts have been identified, perform a miniprep using the Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) or equivalent to obtain template for sequencing. The vector-specific primers can be used for sequencing.\n\n\ne.\nMake a glycerol stock of cultures with the correct inserts for long-term storage of purified and sequence-verified clones.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Preparation of Cells and Transfection\nDue to the species specificity of the human RNA Polymerase I promoter [6], only cells from primate origin with high transfection efficiency (293T or Vero cells) can be used (see\n\nNote 8\n). In general, lower rescue efficiency is observed using Vero cells compared to the 293T cells. Since MDCK cells support the growth of many influenza viruses and can be grown in the same media as 293T cells, co-cultured 293T-MDCK cells can be used to improve the rescue efficiency of some strains of the influenza virus [10].\n\n1.\nPrepare cell cultures: 293T cells and MDCK are maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Vero cells are maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS with the same conditions.\n\n\n2.\nThe day before transfection, trypsinize the cells and plate approximately 2 \u00d7 106 cells/2 mL per well in 6-well cell culture plate. For the 293T-MDCK co-culture, approximately 1 \u00d7 106 cells of each cell line are used. Nearly confluent (95\u2013100%) cells at the time of transfection are ideal.\n\n\n3.\nTransfection: Cells are transfected with a plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\na.\nDilute 1 \u03bcg of appropriate plasmid (or 1 \u03bcg of each plasmid), depending on the experiment, in 250 \u03bcL of Opti-MEM\u00ae I Reduced Serum Medium without serum.\n\n\nb.\nDilute the 2 \u03bcL of Lipofetamine 2000 reagent per 1 mg of DNA used in 250 \u03bcL of Opti-MEM\u00ae I medium. Mix gently and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n\n\nc.\nAfter the 5-min incubation, combine the diluted plasmid with the diluted Lipofectamine 2000. Mix gently and incubate for 20 min at room temperature to allow the plasmid-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes to form.\n\n\nd.\nAdd the 500 \u03bcL of plasmid-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture to the wells containing appropriate cells. Mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth.\n\n\ne.\nIncubate the cells at 37 \u00b0C in a CO2 incubator for 24\u201348 hr depending on the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4. Confirmation of the Integrity of RNA Pol I Promoter and Terminator for Influenza cDNA Transcription\nThe ability of the RNA Pol I promoter in pHH21 vector to drive synthesis of influenza viral RNA can be assessed using different methods. It is useful to generate a cDNA carrying a reporter gene in antisense orientation that is flanked by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions of an influenza viral RNA. This construct can also be used to confirm the integrity of the expression vector (see Section 3.6). In our lab, we constructed the pPolI-NS-GFP plasmid, which contains the GFP gene [derived from pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA)] in an antisense orientation. The antisense GFP coding sequence, flanked by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the nonstructural gene sequences of the A/turkey/Oregon/71 AI virus isolate, was fused exactly between the human RNA polymerase I promoter and the mouse RNA polymerase I terminator sequence in the pHH21 vector. Transfection of this construct into eukaryotic cells leads to transcription of the reporter gene by cellular RNA polymerase I. Upon influenza virus infection, the artificial vRNAs are replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase complex, resulting in the expression of the reporter gene.\n\n1.\nTransfect the nearly confluent 293T or Vero cells with 1 \u03bcg of pPolI-NS-GFP plasmid (see Section 3.4).\n\n\n2.\nTwenty-four hours after transfection, infect the cells with the parent A/turkey/Oregon/71 virus [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1.0].\n\n\n3.\nForty hours after infection, expression of the GFP is evaluated using a microscope with a UV fluorescence lamp. Successful transcription of the artificial RNA will lead to more than 50% expression of the green fluorescence protein.\n\n\nTranscription of the individual RNA segments can be confirmed by the following method:\n\n1.\nTransfect 1 mg of transcription plasmid into 293T cells (see Section 3.4).\n\n\n2.\nExtract total RNA using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n\n3.\nAny DNA contaminants are removed by digestion with DNase I. Briefly, add 1 unit of RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega) and incubate for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C.\n\n\n4.\nRe-extract RNA with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).\n\n\n5.\nPerform the PCR and RT-PCR at the same time with the viral gene sequence-specific primers. Successful transcription of the viral RNA can be confirmed by positive RT-PCR and negative PCR results.\n\n\n\n3.5. Confirmation of Expression by the Plasmids That Provide the Polymerase and NP Proteins\nExpression of the influenza viral proteins PB2, PB1, PA, and NP that are necessary for functional RNP complex can be checked by testing whether the expression of those plasmids leads to the transcription of an artificial vRNA.\n\n1.\nCo-transfect 293T cells with plasmids (1 \u03bcg per plasmid) expressing the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins together with the pPolI-NS-GFP for intracellular synthesis of reporter gene vRNA.\n\n\n2.\nForty-eight hours after transfection, GFP expression can be determined with a fluorescence microscope. Successful expression of the viral proteins leads to more than 50% GFP expression.\n\n\nA fluorescent antibody (FA) test can also be performed if the pPolI-NS-GFP or a similar construct is not available, but an antibody specific for the individual influenza viral protein (e.g., monoclonal antibody against HA protein) has to be available.\n\n1.\nCo-transfect 293T cells with plasmids (1 \u03bcg per plasmid) expressing the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins together with the pHH21 vector that contains, for example, the HA gene if that is a protein to which antibody is available.\n\n\n2.\nForty-eight hours after transfection, wash the cells twice with warm PBS. Add 2 mL of PBS into each well with a serological pipette and swirl plate gently. Discard the PBS and repeat washing. Then fix with 4% para-formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.\n\n\n3.\nWash cells three times as described above with room-temperature PBS, and permeabilize the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 min at room temperature.\n\n\n4.\nWash cells three times as described above with PBS, and block with 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature.\n\n\n5.\nRemove the blocking solution and incubate with HA-specific primary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature.\n\n\n6.\nWash the cells three times with PBS as described above but more thoroughly by gently swirling the plate for 3 min, and incubate with diluted FITC-labeled conjugate for 1 hr at room temperature.\n\n\n7.\nWash the cells three times with PBS thoroughly as described above and evaluate the level of expression with a fluorescence microscope.\n\n\n\n3.6. Generation of Infectious Influenza Viruses Entirely from Cloned cDNAs\nOnce all the reverse-genetic plasmids have been generated and tested for transcription and expression, the infectious virus can be generated by co-transfecting all the plasmids in appropriate cell lines [11] (see Figure 1).\n\n1.\nEight plasmids containing the RNA polymerase I promoter, a cDNA for each of the eight viral RNA segments, and the RNA polymerase I terminator (pHH21-PB2, pHH21-PB1, pHH21-PA, pHH21-HA, pHH21-NP, pHH21-NA, pHH21-M, pHH21-NS) are transfected into cells together with at least four protein expression plasmids (pCR3.1-PB2, pCR3.1-PB1, pCR3.1-PA, pCR3.1-NP) (see\n\nNote 9\n). Use 1 \u03bcg of each plasmid and 24 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent for the transfection (see Section 3.4).\n\n\n2.\nForty-eight hours after transfection, freeze the cells. Repeat the freeze-thaw cycle twice.\n\n\n3.\nCollected supernatant and disrupted cells are subsequently inoculated into 9- to 11-day-old SPF chicken embryos. After 48 hours of incubation, the amnioallantoic fluid containing infectious virus is harvested and may be stored at \u201380 \u00b0C (see\n\nNote 10\n).\n\n\n4.\nThe presence of infectious virus can be confirmed by hemagglutination test (see Chapter 7). Briefly, 50 \u03bcL of 0.5% chicken erythrocyte suspension in PBS are added to 50 \u03bcL of a twofold dilution of virus in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The hemagglutination titer is calculated as the reciprocal value of the highest virus dilution that caused complete hemagglutination.\n\n\n5.\nThe identity of the rescued virus should be confirmed by sequencing of each viral gene segment.\n\n\n\n3.7. Helper Virus-Based Reverse Genetics\nConstruction of eight transcription plasmids for every virus to be rescued can be demanding and labor-intensive. This section briefly describes an alternative method of generating virus using only one transcription plasmid and the helper virus. This method, however, requires a strong selection system for the reassortant virus being rescued.In the helper virus-based reverse genetics, a plasmid containing a cDNA encoding the vRNA to be rescued between the RNA polymerase I promoter and the RNA polymerase I terminator is transfected into cells. Intracellular transcription by RNA polymerase I produces vRNA from a cDNA template, which is then packaged into progeny virus particles upon helper virus infection. With this method, reassortant viruses (i.e., viruses containing RNA derived from cloned cDNA with the remaining genes from a helper virus) are selected from the vast helper virus population and thus require a strong selection system. Here we describe the generation of hemagglutinin (H) gene mutants, which may grow in cell culture without trypsin (an indicator of pathogenicity for poultry) from a low pathogenic parent virus using this system [12] (see Figure 2).\n\n1.\nNearly confluent 293T cells are transfected with 1 mg of transcription plasmid that contains desired HA gene sequences, together with the four expression plasmids by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) (see Section 3.4).\n\n\n2.\nTwenty-four hours after transfection, the cells are infected with either the parent virus from which the HA gene sequence was derived or low pathogenic AI viruses that do not form plaques in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells without the addition of trypsin (MOI = 1.0).\n\n\n3.\nForty hours after infection, the supernatants of the infected cells are collected and used to infect CEF cells.\n\n\n4.\nReassortant viruses in the supernatants are screened by sequencing the virus from plaques formed in the CEF cells. Because the helper virus does not form plaques in CEFs, the presence of plaques indicates the reassortant virus that contains the mutated HA gene, which can grow in cell culture without trypsin.\n\n\nFig. 2Helper virus-dependent reverse genetics system. Cells are transfected with a plasmid containing a cDNA that encodes a mutated HA gene RNA, flanked by RNA polymerase I promoter and terminator sequences. Transcription of mutated HA gene RNA occurs by cellular RNA polymerase I upon transfection. After infection with influenza helper (parental) virus, newly synthesized mutated HA gene RNA undergoes replication and transcription and is packaged into a progeny virus particle. Because the helper virus does not form plaques in CEF cells, the presence of plaques may indicate a reassortant virus containing the mutated HA gene. Reassortants are further confirmed by purification and sequencingFull size image4. Notes\n\n\n1.\nThe primers are designed based on the published sequence. However, influenza viral sequence varies in the noncoding region, and it is recommended to sequence the specific isolate to be rescued and modify the primer sequences accordingly.\n\n\n2.\nIn general, RNA extraction with Trizol reagent yields a higher concentration of RNA than the other two methods. If a high enough titer or high enough concentration of virus is not available, it is recommended to use Trizol reagent and then use less water for the final reconstitution of the RNA pellet.\n\n\n3.\nRT-PCR reactions can introduce unwanted mutations, and the product is not always an accurate copy of the template molecule. To reduce the rate of inaccurate synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, the use of high-fidelity RT-PCR kits available from numerous companies is recommended.\n\n\n4.\nIn many cases, the larger-size genes (PA, PB1, and PB2) are difficult to amplify in full length. In that case, first consider using a two-step RT-PCR reaction, which is, in general, more sensitive than the one-step RT-PCR. If the two-step RT-PCR does not improve the amplification, those gene segments can be amplified in two parts using internal primers and those segments ligated to create a full-length gene.\n\n\n5.\nReverse genetics of influenza virus using 8- or 3-plasmids has also been developed [7, 8]. However, the efficiency of these systems has not been compared side by side.\n\n\n6.\nCloning into the pCR3.1 vector is an easier approach, since subcloning into another vector is not required. We and other researchers [4, 13] have used other eukaryotic expression vectors such as pCI, pCI-neo (Promega), pCAGGS/MCS, and pCDNA3.1.\n\n\n7.\nIf the concentration of the RT-PCR product is too low, it is recommended to clone the product into vectors such as TA vectors (Invitrogen). Then the insert can be efficiently subcloned into the pHH21 vector.\n\n\n8.\nMassin et al. [14] recently cloned the chicken RNA polymerase I promoter sequence and used CEF and QT-6 cells for the generation of the influenza virus.\n\n\n9.\nAlthough infectious viruses can be generated with plasmids expressing just the PA, PB1, PB2, and NP genes, the expression of the remaining structural proteins increases the efficiency of virus production [4].\n\n\n10.\nSome mammalian-origin influenza viruses (such as triple-reassortant H3N2 virus from turkeys) do not grow readily in embryonating chicken eggs or 293T cells [15]; therefore, it is recommended to blind-passage the supernatant from transfected cells three to five times in MDCK cells."}
{"text": "Rescue of influenza C virus from recombinant DNA. \n Abstract \n The rescue of influenza viruses by reverse genetics has been described only for the influenza A and B viruses. Based on a similar approach, we developed a reverse-genetics system that allows the production of influenza C viruses entirely from cloned cDNA. The complete sequences of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 noncoding regions of type C influenza virus C/Johannesburg/1/66 necessary for the cloning of the cDNA were determined for the seven genomic segments. Human embryonic kidney cells (293T) were transfected simultaneously with seven plasmids that direct the synthesis of each of the seven viral RNA segments of the C/JHB/1/66 virus under the control of the human RNA polymerase I promoter and with four plasmids encoding the viral nucleoprotein and the PB2, PB1, and P3 proteins of the viral polymerase complex. This strategy yielded between 103 and 104 PFU of virus per ml of supernatant at 8 to 10 days posttransfection. Additional viruses with substitutions introduced in the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein were successfully produced by this method, and their growth phenotype was evaluated. This efficient system, which does not require helper virus infection, should be useful in viral mutagenesis studies and for generation of expression vectors from type C influenza virus.The influenza C virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, was first isolated in 1947 and is a common cause of mild upper respiratory tract illness. Seroepidemiology studies indicate that this virus is widely distributed around the world and that the majority of humans acquire antibodies against the virus early in life (30). The disease caused by it tends to take an unapparent or very mild course, so that the virus is only exceptionally isolated (29). Furthermore, analysis of the genome sequence of type C influenza viruses isolated over time suggested that reassortment between two different type C influenza viruses occurs frequently in nature (4, 31).It has long been believed that unlike the case for influenza A virus, humans are the only natural host for influenza C viruses (1). Guo et al. (13) succeeded in isolating a number of influenza C viruses from abattoir pigs in Beijing, China, and demonstrated pig-to-pig transmission of the virus upon experimental infection. The presence of specific antibodies was also demonstrated in the serum of pigs in Japan and Great Britain (3, 55). Furthermore, human influenza C virus isolates were found to be closely related to pig isolates, suggesting that interspecies transmission of influenza C virus between humans and pigs has occurred in nature (24). Influenza C virus-specific antibodies were also detected in dogs (26, 27, 39), but detection or isolation of the virus from this animal species has not been documented, although experimental infection resulted in clinical symptoms and viral replication (38). Consequently, influenza C viruses are not restricted to humans, but the potential role of pigs or dogs as an animal reservoir for human influenza C virus remains to be elucidated.In contrast with those of type A and B influenza viruses, the type C influenza virus genome consists of only seven segments of single-stranded RNA of negative polarity, which are numbered based on decreasing lengths, i.e., the PB2, PB1, P3, HEF, NP, M, and NS segments, respectively (reviewed in reference 42). As for type A and B influenza viruses, each viral RNA (vRNA) molecule is associated with the nucleoprotein (NP) and a heterotrimeric polymerase complex (P) that consists of the three polymerase subunits, PB2, PB1, and P3, thus forming the ribonucleoproteins (RNP). Because the minimal replication unit is formed by the RNPs, the generation of virus from cloned cDNAs requires the presence of the seven vRNAs, as well as that of the four viral proteins, PB2, PB1, P3, and NP, involved in the transcription and replication of the viral RNA (6). Reverse-genetics systems that allow the production of infectious virus from cloned cDNA have already been developed for the type A (11, 35) and B (20, 23) influenza viruses and for the Thogoto virus, a tick-transmitted orthomyxovirus (54). Several strategies have been designed. The primary method was based on the transfection of 12 plasmids: the 8 full-length cDNAs derived from the viral genome were cloned into a vRNA expression plasmid between the human RNA polymerase I promoter and the mouse RNA polymerase I terminator, and the coding regions of the nucleoprotein and of the PB2, PB1, and PA viral polymerase proteins were cloned into a protein expression plasmid to provide the four viral proteins required for transcription/replication of the vRNAs (11, 23, 35). The second strategy was based on the use of bidirectional RNA polymerase I/II plasmids to clone the full-length cDNAs derived from each of the viral genomic segments to drive, after transfection, both the expression of the proteins and the synthesis of each of the negative-sense vRNAs (20, 21). More recently, Neumann et al. (34) reduced the number of plasmids required for virus generation to six, five, three, and even one plasmid. Finally, a third recently published strategy is based on the use of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, thus allowing the use of a variety of cell lines (9).To date, no plasmid-based system for the rescue of influenza C virus has been reported. Here we describe a reverse-genetics system for influenza C virus based on the C/Johannesburg/1/66 (C/JHB/1/66) virus strain. Having completed the sequence of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 noncoding (NC) regions of the seven genomic segments of this strain, we chose to base our type C influenza virus reverse-genetics system on the primary method described above for influenza virus types A and B. Plasmids that direct expression of the seven vRNAs under the control of the human RNA polymerase I promoter were thus generated and used together with the four plasmids that direct the expression of the NP, PB2, PB1, and P3 proteins previously described (6).Having set up an efficient reverse-genetics system to rescue wild-type influenza C virus, we tested its usefulness by engineering influenza C viruses mutated in the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein (HEF). The spike glycoproteins of the lipid-enveloped orthomyxoviruses have three functions: to recognize the receptor on the cell surface, to mediate viral fusion, and to destroy the receptor. In type A and B influenza viruses, the first two activities are mediated by the hemagglutinin (HA) and the third by a second glycoprotein, the neuraminidase (42). In the case of type C influenza virus, a single glycoprotein, the HEF protein, possesses all three functions (16). The receptor recognized by HEF differs from that used by the type A and B influenza virus HA by the addition of an acetyl group at the 9-O position of the glycerol side chain of the sialic acid. More precisely, the influenza C virus utilizes the 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) for attachment to the cell surface (19, 46). Because of the lack of Neu5,9Ac2 in the cell surface receptors, Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells (MDCK II cells), which are commonly used for type A and B influenza viruses, are resistant to infection by type C influenza virus. However, their resistance can be overcome by coating the cells with bovine brain gangliosides (BBG), which naturally contain Neu5,9Ac2 (17). The fusion activity of HEF is dependent on the proteolytic cleavage of a precursor (HEF0) into HEF1 and HEF2, the largest and smallest proteolytic cleavage products, respectively (15, 37), and requires activation at a low pH upon internalization of the viral particle through the endosome pathway. Finally, the acetylesterase activity of HEF inactivates the virus receptor by releasing the O-acetyl residues from C-9 of Neu5,9Ac2 (18).Based on published data on residues that could be critical in HEF processing or function (14, 44, 45, 50), we chose to focus on positions 284 and 465 of the HEF protein (amino acid numbering). Indeed, it has been suggested that position 284 of HEF could be involved in receptor binding activity (50), whereas position 465 is located in the peptide fusion domain of HEF (12). Single and double mutants could be rescued, and their phenotype was further analyzed and compared to that of the wild-type virus.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and viruses.293T human embryonic kidney cells and MDCK II cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), respectively. The MDCK cell line was isolated in 1958, and two sublines have been described: MDCK I cells, which derived from an early passage and are susceptible to type C influenza virus, and MDCK II cells, which predominated in later passages and are resistant to type C influenza virus because they lack Neu5,9Ac2 (56).Human skin melanoma cells (SK 93/2) were kindly provided by Frade (Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France) and were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 5% FCS (40, 43).All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 before transfection or infection.Influenza C virus C/JHB/1/66, considered the reference strain, was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated eggs.Determination of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032end NC sequences of genomic RNA segments.Viral genomic RNA was extracted from C/JHB/1/66 using the Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL). The 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC sequence were determined as previously described (7) using an anchored (dT)14 oligonucleotide and primers specific for the coding sequences of each of the seven type C vRNA segments for reverse transcription and amplification. After purification, the PCR products were sequenced with internal oligonucleotides. The exact sequences of the primers used for amplification and sequencing of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC sequences of each segment are available from the authors upon request.Cloning of plasmids.Plasmids pHMG-PB2, -PB1, -P3, and -NP, which direct expression of the PB2, PB1, P3, and NP proteins of the influenza C virus under the control of the mouse hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase promoter, have been described previously (6).To generate plasmids that direct the synthesis of the seven vRNA segments from C/JHB/1/66 virus, PCR products corresponding to each of the full-length segments were cloned in plasmid vector pPR, in which BbsI restriction sites are flanked by the promoter of the human RNA polymerase I and the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequence (6). For cloning of the cDNA corresponding to the PB2, P3, and NP segments, sequences were amplified from the pHMG-PB2, -P3, and -NP plasmids, respectively, using High Fidelity Enzyme Taq polymerase (Roche) and primers containing the total 3\u2032 and the far-end 5\u2032 NC sequences for PB2 and P3 and primers containing the total 3\u2032 and partial 5\u2032 NC sequences for NP. For the cloning of cDNA corresponding to the four other segments, C/JHB/1/66 RNA was reverse transcribed with 300 nM of the C/uni1 primer, 5\u2032-AGC AGA AGC AG, in the presence of 0.4 U/\u03bcl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 37\u00b0C. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR using the High Fidelity Enzyme Taq polymerase for the HEF, M, and NS segments or with the pfx platinium Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) for the PB1 segment. Specifics primers containing the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC sequences were used. For PB1 and HEF, a two-step strategy was necessary. For both segments, two overlapping PCR products corresponding to both halves of the segment were produced. These were then used as templates for a second PCR using the outer primers to generate the full-length cDNA. The 5\u2032 end sequences of all primers contained BsmBI sites. The purified PCR products were then digested with BsmBI and cloned into the BbsI sites of the pPR vector. The sequences of the primers will be provided upon request. The resulting vRNA expression plasmids were named pC/PR/X/JHB, where X corresponds to the name of each segment. To ensure that the genes were free of nonsilent mutations, several plasmids were sequenced for each constructions.Mutations in the HEF gene sequence around nucleotides (nt) 872 and 1414, resulting in Thr-to-Ile and Thr-to-Ala substitutions at residues 284 and 465, respectively, were introduced into the pC/PR/HEF/JHB plasmid using the Quikchange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and verified by sequencing. The double mutant was obtained by subcloning. All plasmids were sequenced using a Big Dye terminator sequencing kit and an automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer).Transfection and rescue of viruses.293T cells (6 \u00d7 105) seeded on 35 mm poly-d-lysine plates (Greiner bio-one) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS were transfected with the four protein expression plasmids, allowing the expression of the NP and the polymerase proteins, and the seven vRNA expression plasmids, allowing the synthesis of the seven vRNA templates, using 0.5 \u03bcg of each plasmid and 10 \u03bcl of FUGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the DNA and the transfection reagent were mixed, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and then added to the cells and incubated at 33\u00b0C. Sixteen hours later, the DNA transfection reagent was removed and the cells were washed twice in DMEM and, after addition of 4 ml of DMEM containing 0.25 \u03bcg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington), incubated at 33\u00b0C. Eight to 10 days after transfection, supernatants were collected and the viruses were titrated by plaque assay on MDCK II cells.Plaque assay.MDCK II cells were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates (106 cells per well). At 100% confluence, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for at least 45 min at 37\u00b0C with 0.4 ml of a solution of BBG (Sigma) at 0.2 mg/ml in PBS. Then, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated with 0.4 ml of each serial dilution of the virus for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, each well was covered with 4 ml of a 1\u00d7 agar overlay mixture (final concentration, 1% SeaKem GTG agarose [Tebu], 1\u00d7 DMEM [Eurobio], 1 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin). Plates were then incubated at 33\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 4 to 5 days: once the plaques were clearly visible, the agar overlay was carefully removed and the cells stained with 0.3% crystal violet solution and 10% formaldehyde. Titers were expressed as PFU/ml.Virus amplification and growth kinetics.SK 93/2 cells were infected with the transfection supernatant at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10\u22123 in RPMI containing 0.25 \u03bcg/ml of TPCK-trypsin at 33\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Five days after incubation, the supernatant was titrated by plaque assay on MDCK II cells. Growth kinetics and analysis of the virus phenotype were performed in duplicate and triplicate, respectively, with viruses amplified once on SK 93/2 cells. MDCK II cells incubated with or without BBG were infected at an MOI of 10\u22123 in DMEM containing 0.25 or 5 \u03bcg/ml of TPCK-trypsin and incubated at 33\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The supernatants were collected each day for determining the kinetics or 4 days after infection for virus phenotype analysis. The virus titers were determined by plaque assay as described above.RNA isolation and RT-PCR.To analyze mutations on the HEF protein, viral RNA was extracted from infectious culture supernatants (140 \u03bcl) by using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was eluted in 60 \u03bcl of buffer and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The rescued influenza C viruses were characterized by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). For synthesis of cDNA, viral RNA (5 \u03bcl) was reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of primer C/uni1 (0.5 \u03bcM). A nested PCR was performed to amplify an 875-nt amplicon in the HEF gene using specific primers (sequences of the four primers are available upon request). The purified PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis before and after digestion with EcoRV or NgoMIV.Nucleotide sequence accession numbers.The GenBank/EMBL/DDJ accession numbers are AF170573, AF170574, AF170575, and AF170576 for the NP, P3, PB1, and PB2 segments, respectively, and AM410041, AM410042, and AM410043 for the HEF, M, and NS segments, respectively.RESULTSComplete sequences of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC regions of genomic RNA segments from influenza virus C/Johannesburg/1/66.As a first step in generating a reverse-genetics system for influenza C virus, we determined the complete sequences of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC regions of the seven segments of the virus C/JHB/1/66/. Indeed, very few complete 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC sequences are available in the GenBank database and not for all segments of the same virus. In the early 1980s, only partial nucleotide sequences of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC regions were determined for the seven genomic segments of C/JHB/1/66 virus by Desselberger et al. (8). The only complete NC sequences of C/JHB/1/66 in the databases were those of the HEF segment (accession numbers M17868 and AY880247) (14). In 1984, Clern-van Haaster and Meier-Ewert (5) also published partial 3\u2032 NC sequences for two other type C virus isolates. Our sequences showed that at the 3\u2032 end, the first 11 nt as well as nt 14 were conserved for the seven segments of C/JHB/1/66. Similarly, at the 5\u2032 end, the first 12 nt and nt 15 were found to be conserved among the seven segments except for the NS segment, for which the U residue at nt 6 was replaced by a G. This was already described for the 5\u2032 end of the NS segment of the C/California/78 virus (accession number M10087).Cloning of cDNAs of the seven vRNA segments of C/JHB/1/66 influenza virus.To generate the vRNA expression plasmids, the cDNAs corresponding to the seven full-length genomic segments of influenza C virus C/JHB/1/66 were cloned as described in Materials and Methods.The sequences of the different clones were then compared with those available in the GenBank database, including our own previous sequences (6). No difference in the nucleotide sequence was found for the PB2, PB1, P3, and NP segments. One nucleotide difference was found for the M segment compared with the sequence available in the database (accession number AB000604), but this mutation was silent.Out of the five nucleotide differences found between our sequence and previously published sequences of HEF of C/JHB/1/66 (14), only position 1414 resulted in a Thr-to-Ala substitution at position 465.For the NS segment, we confirmed the observation made by Marschall et al. (28) and Alamgir et al. (2): i.e., the presence of an additional G residue at position 701 compared with the sequence of C/JHB/1/66 published in 1986 (accession number D00031). Eleven other differences were found with that 1986 sequence, most of them silent (data not shown). When comparing our C/JHB/1/66 NS sequence with that of C/JHB/4/67 published more recently by Alamgir (2), six nucleotide differences were found, three of which were nonsilent mutations that resulted in four amino acid substitutions, two in NS1 (amino acids [aa] 74 and 228) and two in NS2 (aa 124 and 144).Rescue of infectious influenza C virus from cloned cDNAs.The 293T cell line is very easily transfectable but lowly adherent and extremely sensitive to the concentration of trypsin which is required for the cleavage of the HEF glycoprotein (14). We therefore cultured 293T cells on poly-lysine plates to improve the adhesion of the cells and limit their sensitivity to trypsin. A concentration of TPCK-trypsin of 0.25 \u03bcg/ml was found to be optimal to maintain the 293T cell adherence and to obtain viral titers up to 105 to 106 PFU/ml after an infection at an MOI of 10\u22123 with influenza C virus (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that the 293T cells had to be 70 to 80% confluent before transfection, and thus, we decided to use all of these conditions to build our reverse-genetics system for influenza C virus.To produce infectious influenza C virus entirely from cloned cDNAs, the seven plasmids that direct the synthesis of each of the full-length viral RNAs were transfected into 293T cells along with the expression plasmids that encode the three polymerase subunits and NP protein.For three representative experiments, we could detect between 103 and 104 PFU/ml of rescued virus in the supernatant of the transfected cells at 8 or 10 days after transfection (Table 1). Upon amplification on the permissive cell line SK 93/2, titers of 105 to 106 PFU/ml were reached. Similarly, the virus was readily amplified on embryonated eggs to titers of 109 PFU/ml. Furthermore, the virus was successfully recovered for five consecutive passages on SK 93/2 cells (data not shown).For each transfection, an attempt without the HEF vRNA expression plasmid was performed as a negative control and no virus could be rescued (data not shown).Generation of infectious influenza C viruses harboring mutations in the HEF gene.To further validate our reverse-genetics procedure, we explored the possibility of engineering C/JHB/1/66 viruses with mutations in the HEF gene. In 1989, Szepanski et al. (51) obtained a mutant of C/JHB/1/66 able to grow on MDCK II cells in the presence of a high concentration of trypsin. A single mutation at nt 872 of the HEF segment, resulting in a Thr-to-Ile substitution at aa 284 of HEF, was thought to be responsible for this phenotype (50).Based on Szepanski's work, we decided to generate a HEF 284 Ile mutant of C/JHB/1/66 (referred to as 284 virus) by reverse genetics and to test its phenotype. Along with the introduction into plasmid pC/PR/HEF/JHB of the desired nonsilent mutation at nt 872 of the HEF sequence, we also introduced a silent mutation at nt 870 to generate an EcoRV restriction site (Table 2).Based on the observation of a single difference at aa 465 between our sequence and the previously published (14) sequences of the C/JHB/1/66 HEF protein, we replaced the Thr codon found in our sequence with an Ala codon as described by Hanika et al. (14) (465 mutant) and also introduced a new restriction site at that position. For this purpose, two nonsilent (nt 1414 and 1416) nucleotide mutations and one silent (nt 1419) nucleotide mutation were introduced into the cDNA of plasmid pC/PR/HEF/JHB, resulting in the desired amino acid substitution and the creation of a NgoMIV restriction site (Table 2). Finally, a double mutant (284+465 mutant) was also constructed by subcloning to study whether these mutations have independent effects or not.As for the rescued wild-type influenza C virus, the rescued mutant viruses were detected in the supernatant of transfected cells at 9 or 10 days posttransfection. They could easily be titrated by plaque assay, either directly (data not shown) or upon amplification in embryonated eggs and exhibited a plaque phenotype similar to that of the C/JHB/1/66 reference virus (Fig. 1). The titers obtained varied for each mutant but were in a range close to that of the rescued wild-type virus (Table 1). The rescued mutant viruses were then amplified on SK 93/2 cells at an MOI of 10\u22123 to reach titers between 105 and 107 PFU/ml at 5 days postinfection (data not shown). After five consecutive passages on SK 93/2 cells, the stability of the rescued mutant viruses was analyzed by RT-PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion as described in Material and Methods. No amplification was observed for water and mock-infected cells supernatant used as negative controls (Fig. 2, lanes a and f, respectively). The expected 875-nt-long amplicon was observed when the vRNA expression plasmids for HEF and its mutants were used as templates for PCR (Fig. 2A, lanes b to e). With RNA from cells infected with rescued viruses, no amplification was observed without reverse transcription, thus ensuring the absence of plasmids carried over from transfected/infected cells (Fig. 2A, lanes g to j). After RT-PCR, the expected 875-nt-long amplicon was obtained (Fig. 2B, lanes g to j). Only the PCR products of the 284 and the 284+465 mutants were cleaved by EcoRV (Fig. 2C, lanes d, e, i, and j), as were those of the 465 and 284+465 mutants by NgoMIV (Fig. 2D, lanes c, e, h, and j). This confirmed that the rescued mutant viruses were stable after five passages on SK 93/2 cells. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences were confirmed around amino acid positions 284 and 465 for the four rescued viruses (data not shown).Effect of the Thr 465 Ala and Thr 284 Ile mutations in the HEF protein.To analyze the effect of the substitutions at aa 284 and 465 in the HEF protein, determination of growth kinetics was performed with MDCK II cells treated or not with BBG in the presence of a low concentration of TPCK-trypsin (0.25 \u03bcg/ml).As expected, treatment of the cells with BBG was found to be essential for infection by the wild type as well as rescued wild-type or mutant viruses (Fig. 3). On cells pretreated with BBG, the wild-type C/JHB/1/66 reference and rescued viruses showed similar growth (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, rescued wild-type and mutant viruses grew with essentially the same kinetics up to 2 days postinfection (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, for both viruses harboring an Ala at position 465 in HEF (465 and 284+465 viruses), the titers were 10-fold higher than those obtained for both viruses with a Thr 465 (rescued wild-type and 284 viruses) once the plateau phase was reached (after 3 days postinfection).Since Szepanski et al. (50, 51) had shown that the Thr 284 Ile mutation enabled the growth of influenza C virus on untreated MDCK II cells in the presence of a high concentration of trypsin, we compared the ability of each of the four rescued viruses to grow on MDCK II cells without pretreatment with BBG and in the presence of a low (0.25 \u03bcg/ml) or high (5 \u03bcg/ml) concentration of TPCK-trypsin (51). As already mentioned, in the presence of a low concentration of TPCK-trypsin, pretreatment with BBG was necessary to allow infection by the four rescued viruses (Fig. 4). For the wild-type reference and rescued viruses no significant difference in titer was observed when using a low or high concentration of TPCK-trypsin (data not shown). In contrast, in the presence of a high concentration of TPCK-trypsin, titers obtained for both viruses harboring an Ile at position 284 in HEF (284 and 284+465 viruses) were 100-fold higher than those for their respective counterparts with a Thr at position 284 (rescued wild-type and 465 viruses) (Fig. 4). These results thus further demonstrated that the Thr 284 Ile substitution in the HEF is necessary and sufficient to enable influenza C virus to grow on MDCK II cells in the absence of BBG if a high concentration of trypsin is used. Furthermore, it could be noted that the two mutations introduced in the HEF proteins have independent effects on the growth of influenza C virus. On the whole, our results showed that the reverse-genetics system described provides an efficient means to perform site-directed mutagenesis of the HEF sequence of influenza C virus.DISCUSSIONReverse-genetics systems have been previously described only for the type A and B influenza viruses but not for type C. This may be due at least in part to the fact that the complete NC sequences for a given influenza C virus had not been determined and to difficulties related to the type of cells to use, the method of detecting and titrating the type C virus, and the delay before the appearance of rescued virions.The first influenza virus reverse-genetics system described consisted in the rescue of a vRNA segment produced from recombinant plasmid DNA in the presence of a helper virus (10, 25). These experiments paved the way for the rescue of type A influenza virus entirely from cloned cDNA. This was first successful with the trypsin-independent A/WSN/33 strain, for which the authors could use the very efficiently transfectable 293T (11, 35) or Vero cells (41). The system was later improved by making use of a coculture of 293T cells with the highly infectible MDCK cells (21), also allowing the engineering of trypsin-dependent type A influenza viruses. For the type B influenza virus, the system was developed using a coculture of the trypsin-resistant, efficiently transfectable COS7 cells with MDCK cells (20). To set up our reverse-genetics system for the type C influenza virus, we first thought of using cells that are sensitive to type C influenza virus infection. The SK 93/2 cell line, which is highly infectible by type C influenza virus (data not shown), proved to be poorly transfectable by a green fluorescent protein control plasmid, whatever the transfectant agent (FUGENE 6 [Roche], Lipofectamine 2000 [Invitrogen], or Jet PEI [Ozyme]) used (data not shown). Therefore, conditions were developed that allowed efficient growth of influenza C virus on the highly transfectable 293T cells.The second technical problem was related to the detection and titration of the influenza C virus produced by reverse genetics. Usually authors use a red-blood-cell hemagglutination test (17), which detects both virion particles and HEF released in the supernatant. We developed a plaque assay based on the method used for influenza A virus (52). It was not possible to use the SK 93/2 cells, because they are not adherent enough, and only MDCK II cell monolayers remained intact when the agarose overlay was removed before staining with crystal violet (data not shown). Their resistance to infection with type C influenza virus was successfully overcome by coating the cells with BBG, which naturally contain Neu5,9Ac2 (17) and allowed the development of a reproducible plaque assay for influenza C virus on MDCK II cells (Fig. 1).It is well known that at the optimal temperature of 33\u00b0C, the type C influenza virus grows on susceptible cells more slowly than type A at 35\u00b0C or type B at 33\u00b0C. Because of this slow virus growth, contrary to the case with type A and B influenza viruses, for which viruses rescued by reverse genetics were detected as soon as 24 or 36 h posttransfection (20, 35), the wild-type type C influenza virus rescued by our reverse-genetics system was first detectable in the supernatant of transfected cells only at 6 days posttransfection (data not shown), and the maximum yield was obtained only at day nine or ten. Also, for the titration by plaque assay, plaques of type A or B influenza virus usually appeared after 3 days, whereas for type C, plaques were clearly detected only after 4 or 5 days.The reverse-genetics system we developed for influenza C virus is efficient and might be further improved. Indeed, coculture of highly transfectable cells, such as 293T, COS (20), or Vero (11) cells, with highly infectible cells, such as SK 93/2, might help to rescue viruses more efficiently. No improvement was observed when using 293T and SK 93/2 cells cocultured at a 1/1 ratio (data not shown), but different ratios need to be tested, as well as coculture with other cells permissive for influenza C virus. Alternatively, one could try to directly transfect the SK 93/2 cells by a more efficient method, such as electroporation or nucleofection (Amaxa Biosystems). Finally, as was done for type A and B influenza virus systems (20, 22, 34), one could wish to reduce the number of plasmids. However, to study mutations that affect the polymerase complex (structure or activity), a system that separates the vRNA and protein expression plasmids should be preferred for the rescue of mutant viruses. Indeed, if the mutation introduced in the vRNA affects the activity of the polymerase complex protein, a system based on bidirectional plasmids might not allow the reconstruction of functional RNPs and hence the rescue of the mutant virus.Using our reverse-genetics system, based entirely on plasmids, we successfully generated influenza C viruses with mutations in the HEF protein. The Thr 465 Ala substitution resulted in an increase of virus growth capabilities (Fig. 3 and 4). Residue 465 is located in the peptide fusion domain of the HEF2 subunit, which is involved in the fusion of the virus envelope and cell membranes (42). The work of Formanowski et al. (12) indicated that amino acid substitutions involving a change of charge in HEF2 might be responsible for the variation of the pH optimum for fusion among influenza C virus strains. Since the Thr-to-Ala substitution replaced a polar residue with a nonpolar residue, the global hydrophobicity of the fusion peptide might be increased and the fusion capabilities of the virus enhanced, thus explaining the difference in growth properties. Interestingly, we also noticed that recovery of the 465 Ala viruses by reverse genetics seemed to be easier, since the virus yields in the supernatant of the transfected cells repeatedly reached about 104 PFU/ml at 6 days after transfection, i.e., 10- to 100-fold more than for the wild-type-like virus at that time (data not shown). This could prove useful for studying the positive or negative effects of mutations in any of the seven segments on the growth and replication of influenza C virus.Using our reverse-genetics system, we confirmed that the Thr 284 Ile mutation in HEF described by Szepanski et al. (50) was associated with the capability of influenza C virus to grow on MDCK II cells in the presence of a high concentration of trypsin. Thr 284 in the HEF was found to be conserved in all sequences available in the GenBank database for influenza C virus strains isolated between 1950 and 2000. For the hemagglutinin of influenza A virus, it was shown that a single point mutation can have a drastic effect on the receptor-binding activity (47, 49). For instance, for the H1 and H3 subtypes, position 226 in the HA was shown to determine the receptor specificity by the recognition of \u03b12,3-linked or \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids (36, 47, 53). Similarly, Suzuki et al. (49) showed that position 205 in H1 can on its own influence the binding specificity. The substitution at residue 193 of H3 altered the binding of the hemagglutinin from human or equine influenza A viruses (32). The Thr 284 Ile substitution in the HEF protein of influenza C virus was described by Szepanski et al. for a mutant virus obtained by passaging C/JHB/1/66 on MDCK II cells in the presence of a high concentration of trypsin (50, 51). Our results further demonstrated that the Thr 284 Ile substitution is necessary and sufficient to enable influenza C virus to grow on MDCK II cells at a high concentration of trypsin in the absence of BBG. Based on adhesion assays on ganglioside-treated red blood cells (50), it was suggested that an Ile at position 284 would enhance the affinity of HEF for the Neu5,9Ac2 sialic acid receptor. Since position 285 of HEF was found to be directly involved in receptor binding (48), it is possible that an Ile at position 284 induces a conformational change in the structure of the receptor-binding pocket. However, how and where the trypsin acts in this process is not clear at present. It seems rather unlikely that a high concentration of trypsin could improve the cleavage of HEF, since similar effects would be expected irrespective of the nature of the residue at position 284. It is then possible that another low-affinity cleavage site, which would be recognized by trypsin, could be revealed by a change of conformation of the HEF protein of 284 Ile viruses. This would in turn lead to changes in the HEF properties that could be involved in the observed growth phenotype. Alternatively, trypsin at a high concentration could act on the MDCK II cells and unmask Neu5,9Ac2 sialic acids that would be present in very small amounts on the MDCK II cells. This could explain why only the 284 Ile viruses, with their enhanced HEF affinity for the receptor, would grow in these conditions.Our system for influenza C virus completes the series of reverse-genetics systems for the different genera of the Orthomyxoviridae family. While this paper was under review, a similar system was described for type C influenza virus C/Ann Arbor/1/50 by Muraki et al. (33). These will prove extremely helpful for addressing a number of questions in the field of influenza virus research, with a particular interest for the type specificity requirements. Having the technology to introduce any viable mutation into the influenza C virus genome will enable us to study the viral life cycle and its regulation, the structure-function relationships of the different viral proteins, or the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenicity (notably the limited pathogenicity recorded for influenza C virus). Finally, one could try to engineer influenza C viruses to generate expression vectors, which could then be used as live vaccines.FIG. 1.FIG. 1.

{"text": "An adenovirus vector-mediated reverse genetics system for influenza A virus generation. \n Abstract \n Plasmid-based reverse genetics systems allow the generation of influenza A virus entirely from cloned cDNA. However, since the efficiency of virus generation is dependent on the plasmid transfection efficiency of cells, virus generation is difficult in cells approved for vaccine production that have low transfection efficiencies (e.g., Vero cells). Here we established an alternative reverse genetics system for influenza virus generation by using an adenovirus vector (AdV) which achieves highly efficient gene transfer independent of cell transfection efficiency. This AdV-mediated reverse genetics system will be useful for generating vaccine seed strains and for basic influenza virus studies.The artificial generation of influenza A virus entirely from cloned cDNA in plasmid-transfected cells, the so-called \u201cplasmid-based reverse genetics system\u201d (1, 13), represents an important advance in influenza virology (12, 15). This technology has advanced both basic and applied research on influenza virus, most notably, the development of vaccine seed strains for highly pathogenic influenza viruses, including the currently circulating H5N1 viruses (5, 17-20).Since, until recently, at least eight plasmids had to be transfected into a single cell for virus generation, the limiting factor for plasmid-based reverse genetics was the transfection efficiency of the cells. In general, 293T cells, which are readily transfected with plasmids (2), have been used for plasmid-based systems (4, 13). However, 293T cells cannot be used for the development of human vaccine seed strains because they are not validated for such use. African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, which have been used for the production of rabies virus and poliovirus vaccines (9), are the WHO-recommended cell line for vaccine production (20), but these cells are not readily transfected (6-8). It is therefore difficult to efficiently generate influenza viruses by using plasmid-based systems in these cells, although some success has been achieved (1, 16, 19).To address these limitations, we established a reverse genetics system that uses adenovirus type 5-based gene transfer, which has been safely administered in numerous clinical trials (21). A replication-incompetent adenovirus vector (AdV) with E1 and E3 deleted that possesses the cDNAs of viral RNA (vRNA) under the control of the human RNA polymerase I (PolI) promoter and the mouse PolI terminator allowed efficient vRNA synthesis and led to a high virus yield in Vero cells. These results suggest that the AdV-mediated system would be valuable for the production of vaccine seed strains in pandemic situations.AdV-mediated synthesis of influenza virus RNA.In plasmid-based reverse genetics systems, plasmids possessing the cDNA of viral genes under the control of the human PolI promoter and the mouse PolI terminator have been used for vRNA synthesis (13). Therefore, we cloned the cDNA corresponding to the transcriptional region of pPolI-GFP (Fig. 1A) (14) into pAd/PL-DEST (Invitrogen), which contains the genome sequence of human adenovirus type 5 with E1 and E3 deleted as a viral vector backbone, by means of the Gateway system using LR clonase (Invitrogen). Transfection of the resultant plasmid into 293A cells produced AdV for the synthesis of a reporter vRNA (AdV/PolI-GFP, Fig. 1B).To test whether AdV/PolI-GFP can produce the reporter vRNA in Vero cells, we transduced this AdV into cells. These cells were simultaneously transfected with four plasmids to express the A/WSN/33(H1N1, WSN) viral polymerase subunits (PB2, PB1, and PA) and NP, which are necessary and sufficient for vRNA transcription and replication and which form the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) with vRNA. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) used was 50, an MOI at which >99% of the cells express a transduced gene (data not shown). Forty-eight hours later, we detected green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing cells (Fig. 2B), whereas no GFP expression was detected in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). AdV/PolI-GFP transduction of Vero cells thus resulted in the synthesis of the reporter vRNA.To provide the vRNP components entirely from AdVs, we made four additional AdVs for the expression of the polymerase subunits and NP (AdV/CMV-PB2, -PB1, -PA, and -NP) by cloning the cDNAs corresponding to the open reading frames of each WSN viral protein into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen). Cotransduction of these AdVs into Vero cells with AdV/PolI-GFP (MOI = 50) resulted in highly efficient GFP expression 48 h posttransduction (Fig. 2C). These results show that AdV transduction achieves functional vRNP formation at a much higher efficiency than does plasmid transfection in Vero cells.To determine the optimal ratio of AdVs for protein expression to vRNA synthesis, AdV/PolI-GFP was transduced into Vero cells at different MOIs together with AdV/CMV-PB2, -PB1, -PA, and -NP (MOI = 50). The results showed that fivefold fewer AdVs for vRNA synthesis than for viral protein expression are sufficient for efficient functional vRNP formation (data not shown).Influenza virus generation entirely from AdVs.To generate infectious influenza virus entirely from AdVs, we cloned PolI transcription cassettes for all eight WSN vRNAs (13) into pAd/PL-DEST and made eight AdVs for the synthesis of each vRNA segment. Vero cells were cotransduced with a total of 12 AdVs, 8 AdVs for vRNA synthesis (MOI = 10) and 4 AdVs for viral protein expression (MOI = 50). To compare the efficiencies of virus generation, two methods of plasmid-based reverse genetics were used, the 12-plasmid system (11) and the 3-plasmid system (10). At 72 h after AdV transduction or plasmid transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and subjected to plaque assay on MDCK cells to determine the amounts of virus generated. Influenza virus was detected in the supernatant of cells transduced with 12 AdVs (Fig. 3), demonstrating the capacity of this AdV-mediated reverse genetics system for influenza virus generation. The virus yield from the 12-AdV transduced cells was approximately 1,000-fold higher than that from the 12-plasmid transfected cells and comparable to that from the 3-plasmid transfected cells (Fig. 3).Influenza virus generation from eight AdVs based on the PolI-PolII bidirectional transcription system.To reduce the number of AdVs required for virus generation, we tested whether the PolI-PolII bidirectional transcription approach, which allows the simultaneous synthesis of vRNA and mRNA from one template (3), would be applicable to our AdV-mediated reverse genetics system. By cloning the transcriptional region in pPolI-GFP into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST, we made AdV/CMV-PolI-GFP (Fig. 1C). Vero cells transduced only with this AdV (MOI = 50) expressed GFP at a relatively low level at 48 h posttransduction (Fig. 2D). Cotransduction with AdV/CMV-PB2, -PB1, -PA, and -NP enhanced the GFP expression level in individual cells (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that AdV/CMV-PolI-GFP transduction induces the synthesis of both the reporter vRNA and mRNA.To generate infectious influenza virus from eight AdVs, we cloned PolI transcription cassettes for all eight WSN vRNAs into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST and made eight AdVs containing the bidirectional transcription cassette for each vRNA segment. Vero cells were cotransduced with these AdVs (MOI = 50). The virus yields were determined at 72 h posttransduction by plaque assay on MDCK cells. The amount of virus generated in Vero cells with the 8 AdVs was approximately 10,000-, 10-, and 10-fold higher than those obtained with the 12-plasmid (P = 0.032), 3-plasmid (P = 0.045), and 12-AdV (P = 0.035) systems, respectively (Fig. 3).Here, we demonstrate that the limitation of transfection efficiency of target cells is overcome by using AdV as a gene transfer vehicle. Influenza virus RNA was efficiently transcribed (Fig. 2C and E), and influenza virus was generated with high efficiency in Vero cells transduced with AdV possessing the PolI promoter and terminator (Fig. 3). Moreover, the eight-AdV transduction system, based on the PolI-PolII bidirectional transcription system (4), achieved a statistically significant increase in virus yield compared to the other systems, including the recently established three-plasmid transfection system (10). Given the relative ease of preparation, the eight-AdV transduction system appears ideal for the efficient generation of influenza vaccine seed strains. This AdV-mediated reverse genetics system could also contribute to basic studies of influenza virus.FIG. 1.FIG. 1. Schematic diagrams of the transcription cassettes of pPolI and AdVs for reporter vRNA synthesis. In pPolI-GFP (14), the 3\u2032 noncoding region of NP vRNA (3\u2032 NCR), the GFP open reading frame in the negative sense, and the 5\u2032 noncoding region of NP vRNA (5\u2032 NCR) were inserted between the PolI promoter (PPolI) and the PolI terminator (TPolI). In cells transfected with pPolI-GFP, the reporter vRNA containing the GFP gene is synthesized by cellular PolI (A). AdV/PolI-GFP possessed the same transcription cassette of pPolI-GFP for reporter vRNA synthesis (B). The vRNA transcriptional region in AdV/CMV-PolI-GFP was flanked by the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (PCMV) and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase polyadenylation signal (TK pA). In cells transduced with AdV/CMV-PolI-GFP, the reporter vRNA and mRNA containing the GFP genes are synthesized by cellular PolI and PolII, respectively. The backbone of the adenovirus clones (Ad) was the genome of adenovirus type 5 with E1 and E3 deleted. The transcriptional initiation site and orientation of the GFP gene are indicated by the white arrow. All of the recombinant replication-incompetent AdVs used in this study were produced by the ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.FIG. 2.FIG. 2. GFP expression in Vero cells transduced with AdVs for reporter vRNA synthesis. Vero cells were transduced with AdV/PolI-GFP (A to C) and AdV/CMV-PolI-GFP (D and E). Simultaneously, the cells were transfected with plasmids (B) or transduced with AdVs (C and E) for the expression of the polymerase subunits (PB2, PB1, and PA) and NP. Forty-eight hours later, GFP expression was examined by fluorescence microscopy. In each experiment, each AdV was transduced at an MOI of 50. The image in panel D was taken with a 10-fold longer exposure time than those in the other panels. Scale bars, 200 \u03bcm.FIG. 3.FIG. 3. Comparison of the virus generation efficiency of plasmid transfection systems and AdV transduction systems. Vero cells were transfected with 12 plasmids (11) or 3 plasmids (pTM-PolI-WSN-All, pC-PolII-WSN-PB2-PB1-PA, and pCAWS-NP) (10) or transduced with 12 AdVs (AdV/PolI-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -HA, -NP, -NA, -M, and -NS and AdV/CMV-PB2, -PB1, -PA, and -NP) or 8 AdVs (AdV/CMV-PolI-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -HA, -NP, -NA, -M, and -NS). Seventy-two hours later, virus titers in culture supernatant were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells. The virus titer detection limit of our system was 5 PFU/ml. The results of three independent experiments (Exp.) are shown.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Susan Watson for editing the manuscript.This work was supported by CREST (Japan Science and Technology Agency) and by grants-in-aid from the Ministries of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology and of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan and by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Public Health Service, research grants."}
